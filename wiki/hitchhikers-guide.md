# How We work – Hitchhiker's Guide to CorrelAid

Our goal with CorrelAid is to democratize the potential of Data Science. In practice, we achieve this by supporting a network of over many data enthusiasts in Germany, by giving them the opportunity to grow, and by organizing pro-bono data science projects for civil society. But how do we work _internally_? This is an overview of how we organize ourselves at CorrelAid, how we work and which principles we follow.

## Our Code of Conduct and Code of Ethics

## Our Impact

* Empowering NPOs to use data in a critical and reflective way to achieve their goal.&#x20;
* Enabling effective engagement (self-effective for volunteers & effective for NPOs).&#x20;
* Participation of marginalised groups within data science.

## Our Organization

We are formed as an association ("Verein" in German). In practice, however, the official organs of the association only have a secondary role. Instead, most of the structures we work in are informal, always potentially changing and ad-hoc.

### Structure

#### _The Assocation_

[board](board.md), ethics committee, general assembly + members&#x20;

#### _The Remote Office Team_

full-/part-time employees&#x20;

#### _The Volunteer Community_

Core-Crew-Crowd

### Communication

#### _Slack Workspace_

All our online communication takes place in our Slack Workspace. We have a channel for all important topics in which we organize our work. In addition, there are channels for technical questions and a channel for interesting links and projects. Our work takes place almost exclusively in public Slack channels. If you want to join our Slack Workspace, just drop a short email to [info@correlaid.org](mailto:info@correlaid.org) or visit our [monthly onboarding call](https://pretix.eu/correlaid/open-onboarding/).
