# How We work – Hitchhiker's Guide to CorrelAid

{% hint style="info" %}

Our goal with CorrelAid is to democratize the potential of Data Science. In practice, we achieve this by supporting a network of over many data enthusiasts in Germany, by giving them the opportunity to grow, and by organizing pro-bono data science projects for civil society. But how do we work _internally_? This is an overview of how we organize ourselves at CorrelAid, how we work and which principles we follow.

## Our Code of Conduct and Code of Ethics

## Our Impact

* Empowering NPOs to use data in a critical and reflective way to achieve their goal.&#x20;
* Enabling effective engagement (self-effective for volunteers & effective for NPOs).&#x20;
* Participation of marginalised groups within data science.

## Our Organization

We are formed as an association ("Verein" in German). In practice, however, the official organs of the association only have a secondary role. Instead, most of the structures we work in are informal, always potentially changing and ad-hoc.

### Structure

#### _The Assocation_

board, ethics committee, general assembly + members&#x20;

#### _The Remote Office Team_

full-/part-time employees&#x20;

#### _The Volunteer Community_

Core-Crew-Crowd

### Communication

#### _The Slack Workspace_

All our online communication takes place in our Slack Workspace. We have a channel for all important topics in which we organize our work. In addition, there are channels for technical questions and a channel for interesting links and projects. Our work takes place almost exclusively in public Slack channels. If you want to join our Slack Workspace, just drop a short email to [info@correlaid.org](mailto:info@correlaid.org) or visit our [monthly onboarding call](https://pretix.eu/correlaid/open-onboarding/).

### Meetings and strategic planning

#### _CorrelCon_

Once a year we invite our community to a weekend to exchange ideas, learn new things and plan future projects for CorrelAid. The structure is usually as follows: a public event on Friday evening, a day full of Data Science Workshops on Saturday, and workshops on the development of CorrelAid on Sunday. Everybody can participate regardless of how long they have been with us in the network, how much experience they have in data science or how they want to get involved - data4good projects and/or organizational work. The Data-for-Good Summit is usually held in autumn.

#### _Core Team Retreat_

Also once a year our Core Team meets to review the year and plan internal projects for the upcoming months. This personal exchange is very important to us, because otherwise we communicate exclusively online.

## Roles and decision making

So how does cooperation work without fixed departments and hierarchies? How are decisions made? This is perhaps the most important point of our cooperation, which we do not communicate sufficiently: The most important concept is that of _**self-management**_. This replaces the concept of _hierarchy_ in our company. In our team, different people take on different roles which they fill out in an independent, self-sufficient way. Some of those roles are formally developed at the Data-for-Good Summit or at the Strategy Meeting. However, more often, internal projects and ideas developed organically upon the initiative of individual Core Team members. The implementation and decisions related to their ideas are primarily the responsibility of the individual persons - with the support and advice of the other members of the Core Team.

A few examples of great internal initiatives: Our Regina in Bamberg takes care of our [local group concept](../correlaidx-manual/what-is-correlaidx.md). Arndt in Berlin has in the past developed the [way we do our projects](broken-reference/), and Manuel has brought numerous projects from initial contact with the organization to the call for applications. Jasmin in Konstanz organizes our education sector and is the host of our[ CorrelAid podcast](https://www.spreaker.com/show/correltalk-the-correlaid-podcast). Leo in Karlsruhe had the idea to write an [R-Package](https://github.com/CorrelAid/newsanchor) with a small project team and thus introduce people to the topic of R package development. Jan programmed our website and organized [hackathons](https://correlaid.org/blog/hackathon-gleif/) with partners from industry and academia. Thanks to Lena in Frankfurt, we have a [unified design guide](design-guide.md) and you can order cool, hand-embroidered [CorrelAid shirt](https://dezent.me/c/projects/correlaid)! Thomas has been our source of advice for everything GDPR and data protection. Rahel has organized several events and worked on grant applications. Hendrik, Andre, Andrew, Joel, Fabian, and Liubov have successfullly started [CorrelAidX](../correlaidx-manual/what-is-correlaidx.md) chapters all over Europe. And so the list goes on...

Some (also annoying) tasks have to be taken care of regularly in an association. Konstantin in Mannheim (and before him, Jan K.) submits our tax return every year and manages our finances. Rahel in Berlin curates and sends out our newsletter. Yannik in Stuttgart maintains our blog. Without this continuous and conscientious commitment, our work would not be possible.

The bottom-line is: **If you have a cool idea you want to implement at/with CorrelAid, we will support you with resources to realize your idea. You are free in the design and in your decisions - a team of 20 people will be there in calls and on Slack to support you.**
