# Design Guide

### General

The purpose of this short design guideline is to explain the use of our CorrelAid-specific corporate design and to reinforce the consistent use of visual elements in all communication. This includes publications, presentations and all other marketing materials both online and offline. Our Corporate Identity was developed by _Das Gute Ruft - Agentur für öko-soziale Unternehmen und Vereine_ - the information listed here is mostly based on the Design Guide from June 2018. An update to updated and new logos as well as colours and fonts took place in **June 2025**, thanks to the support of Medialer GmbH, agency for 3D animation & digital marketing.

The old [Design Guide](https://drive.google.com/file/d/19j58kbO_rC_mNlWVuj5sbqE66SN42h3g/view?usp=sharing) (from 2018) is available in our Google Workspace, as well as the [new brand guide](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1RgrZ9eHSWRod5TNNqfjdgm_Feo8jVkf-/view) (from 2025) for our main CorrelAid brand. You can find all current [logos / existing designs](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1XrHj0T3tNKjtGAp2UebpJpRF_Y8BaWJM?usp=sharing) in the Google Workspace as well as in the Canva team:

### Logos

The CorrelAid main logo is the central element of the brand's visual identity. It is a word-image brand - this makes the logo flexible and usable for a wide range of applications.

#### Main Logo

![Main logo](<../../.gitbook/assets/Main_CorrelAid horizontal.png>)

There are four variations of this main logo which can be used on dark and light ground, with slogan or without. The files are stored as .png, .eps and .svg in the [Google Workspace](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1XrHj0T3tNKjtGAp2UebpJpRF_Y8BaWJM?usp=sharing).&#x20;

The horizontal or vertical version of the logo is used in various scenarios - depending on which suits the format better and ensures good legibility.

The horizontal version is suitable for smaller formats in which the standard versions do not work.\
The C logo or icon is intended for very small applications, e.g. as a favicon.

The inverted version is intended for medium to dark backgrounds.

The black and white inverted version can be used on uneven backgrounds, as a watermark or for single-colour printed matter.

The pure black and white version serves as a fallback for monochrome prints.

#### CorrelLAB Logos

The CorrelLAB logo is a modification of the CorrelAid main logo and is composed as a word/image mark. In addition to the “C”, the word “LAB” also appears, with an iconised “L”.&#x20;

There are five variations of this main logo which can be used on dark and light ground, including and in the combination of the “C” only with the word “LAB” and the iconised “L” on its own.

#### Local Chapter Logos

The CorrelAidX logos are an adaptation of the former main logos. In addition to the "C", the logo also shows the suffix "X" which expresses that CorrelAid is available in various cities. Instead of the claim the city name is inserted in line 2. If you want to customize a logo specifically for your city, please contact [Isabel](mailto:isabel.w@correlaid.org), [Nora](mailto:nora.b@correlaid.org) or the [#pr](https://app.slack.com/client/T05092DNR/C0BRFPMNE/rimeto_profile/UDP7BTC65)-team. The logos are stored as .png and .svg in the [Google Workspace](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1XrHj0T3tNKjtGAp2UebpJpRF_Y8BaWJM?usp=sharing).&#x20;

Here's an example:

#### Additional Logos

For some events we need more specific logos that can be easily and quickly designed with Canva. Please check the PR-folder in the [Google Workspace](https://drive.google.com/drive/shared-drives) or the [Canva-Team](https://docs.correlaid.org/wiki/design-guide#canva) folder for more designs.&#x20;

If you need a special CorrelAid logo version, just contact contact [Isabel ](mailto:isabel.w@correlaid.org)or the [#pr](https://app.slack.com/client/T05092DNR/C0BRFPMNE/rimeto_profile/UDP7BTC65)-team. To avoid brand confusion, please do not create your own logo versions.

### Color Concepts

Looking at the previous logos, it becomes clear that there are different colour concepts for the CorrelAid, CorrelLAB and CorrelAidX main brands. These are briefly explained here.

he CorrelAid logo picks up the colour spectrum from green to blue. The colour spectrum of the CorrelLAB logo ranges from blue to a strong shade of pink. The color red is primarily used in the logo design of CorrelAid X (cities / regional organizations). In addition, dark grey is used as a contrast color. Please adhere to the given colour values in future designs and representations in order to keep our products combinable.

The colors for easier copy+paste:

* Blues: #00468A, #2467B8, #4787E5
* Purple: #A369D2, #D19DC8
* Pink: #FFA4BE, #FE6D97, #FC356F

![Colour segements CorrelAidX](https://i.imgur.com/3g9wIbz.png)

The CorrelAidX logo picks up the colour spectrum from red to blue. Besides the X, the color red is a main differentiator between CorrelAid and CorrelAid X and should therefore be used uniformly. Dark grey is again used as contrast colour.

### Font

The ‘Roboto’ and ‘Inter’ font families were chosen for CorrelAid's corporate design. In detail, we use ‘Roboto Regular’ and ‘Robot' Bold’, as well as ‘Inter Regular’ and ‘Inter Bold’ - please do not use any other fonts for reasons of consistency. ‘Roboto Regular’ is generally used for the body text, while headings 1 2 appear in ‘Inter Bolt’ (optionally capitalised) and heading 3 appears in ‘Inter Regular’.

### Canva

CorrelAid has a [Canva ](http://canva.com)Pro-Account, on which certain basic rules, such as club colors, logos, fonts, etc. are already maintained. There are a lot of templates for flyers, social media posts etc. in the [layout folder](https://www.canva.com/teams/layouts) of the team. If you want to design a product (flyer, poster, FB banner...) for your local group / information event, please contact [Isabel](mailto:isabel.w@correlaid.org), [Nora](mailto:nora.b@correlaid.org) or the [#pr](https://app.slack.com/client/T05092DNR/C0BRFPMNE/rimeto_profile/UDP7BTC65)-team to get access to the CorrelAid-Team in Canva.&#x20;
