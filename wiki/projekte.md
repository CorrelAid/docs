# Projects

{% hint style="warning" %}
We have a full project handbook but it needs to be updated and translated to English - the first few pages are already in the [project manual]() \(scroll down in the table of contents on the left side\). You can find the full old German version [here](https://correlaid.github.io/projekthandbuch/). Until we have completed the update of the project handbook, feel free to pose any questions in the \#projects channel in [Slack](faq.md#everything-seems-to-be-on-slack-how-do-i-get-on-there). If you want to help in the process or are interested in volunteering as a project coordinator \(i.e. organizing projects\), contact Manuel Neumann \(@Manuel\) or Frie \(@frie\) on Slack.
