# Slack

Our main communication channel is Slack. Slack is like a collection of WhatsApp group chats but better - including better file sharing and most important: custom emojis and a very good giphy integration for all kinds of shenanigans. 😉 

We use Slack for to coordinate the local chapters as well as for the organization of the activities of "central" CorrelAid, e.g. the organization of projects, meetups, etc. For example:

* Once a week - usually Mondays at 8pm - we have our [**weekly conference call** ](weekly-conference-call.md)in the \#telko channel. Feel free to join the Slack call there, we always like to hear new voices!
* During the week, we work on the different CorrelAid topics in the **channels**. Channels are either designated to a certain topic \(e.g. \#projekte for projects, \#netzwerk-bildung for eductation, \#anträge for collaborating on grant proposals\) or are focused on local chapters \(\#lc-bremen, \#lc-berlin, \#lc-mannheim, ...\). If you are interested in a certain topic and/or local chapter, you can join the corresponding channel\(s\) to see what's already going on. Or even better: **share your ideas**!
* If you need help with anything related to CorrelAid or data science or coding, feel free to ask away in the **\#netzwerk-help** channel.
* found a funny Meme or Gif and need to share with someone? Stumbled across a very useful tutorial for something? Post it to \#random!
* **Have a new idea that doesn't fit in any channel? Need people to join you for something exciting?** Post it in \#general!

{% hint style="warning" %}
It's really easy to lose track of things in Slack and the core team cannot read everything that's going on. So if you've been working on some great idea / project, **please update the core team from time to time** - either through the [weekly conference call](weekly-conference-call.md), a direct message to someone from the core team or a post in \#general or another more populated channel!
