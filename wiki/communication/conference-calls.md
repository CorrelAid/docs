# Conference calls  â€‹â˜Ž

The conference calls \(also called "**TelKos**" from German "**Tel**efon**ko**nferenz" which is the translation of "conference call"\) are probably the most important CorrelAid communication channel. â˜Ž 

## Call schedule

Up until 2020, we had a call every week. However, we've found that this is not ideal anymore as we grow and more and more people join the core team. Hence, we've decided on a new call schedule: __Calls are generally on **Monday at 7pm \(Berlin time\)** until agreed upon otherwise. On the 2nd and 4th Monday of each month, the "regular" Core Team call takes place. On the first and third Monday, we take the time to focus on specific groups in our network: CorrelAid "newbies" and our local chapters. 

Because it's hard to remember such things, we have a [calendar](../infrastructure/correlaid-calendar.md) with all the calls for you to add to your favorite calendar application.

Ps: Before anyone asks: In case there's a 5th Monday in a month, there is no call. ðŸ˜‰
