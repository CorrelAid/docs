# Conference calls ​☎

The conference calls (also called "**TelKos**" from German "**Tel**efon**ko**nferenz" which is the translation of "conference call") are an important CorrelAid communication channel. :telephone: In addition to the general calls here, there are typically a lot more calls going on each week: in local chapters, project teams, and other internal initiatives/projects (e.g. the podcast team). Check out the respective channel to learn more about when the next virtual meeting is going to happen.

## Call schedule

### Open / Onboarding Call: 1st Monday

**What:** Open / onboarding call. This call is open to anyone who is interested in our work. We share important updates from the CorrelAid world, answer questions and provide some onboarding information for CorrelAid "newbies".

**When**: 1st Monday of each month, 7pm (Berlin time).

**Where**: The open call is held on Zoom. To register and to get access to the link, click [here](https://pretix.eu/correlaid/open-onboarding/) or take a look at our [event calendar](https://correlcloud.org/index.php/apps/calendar/p/w4ak9WY4T6Ln452r). It should be possible to participate in your browser without downloading the Zoom client on Mac and Windows. On Linux, it might be necessary to download the [Zoom client](https://support.zoom.us/hc/en-us/articles/204206269-Installing-Zoom-on-Linux) which should be available in the package manager of your distribution. If this does not work for you, please feel free to drop us an [email](mailto:frie.p@correlaid.org) so that we can look for an alternative that works smoothly on all operating systems.

### CorrelAidX / Local Chapter Call: 3rd Monday

**What:** [CorrelAidX](../../correlaidx-manual/what-is-correlaidx.md) local chapter coordination call. This call is for representatives of our local CorrelAidX chapters to exchange ideas, resources and strategies on how to implement data for good on the local level.

**When**: 3rd Monday of each month, 7pm (Berlin time).

**Where**: The local chapter call is held on [Slack](../faq.md#everything-seems-to-be-on-slack-how-do-i-get-on-there) in the #lc-team channel. You need to download the app or the desktop version in order to participate in the call - the browser version is not sufficient from our experience. If you do not have a Slack account yet, you can easily get one - see [here](../faq.md#everything-seems-to-be-on-slack-how-do-i-get-on-there).
