## Gmail -> Infrastructure

### I need my own @correlaid.org email address. How do I get it?

Request a Google Workspace account via this [form](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLScJYiZDTlo0S4N7eeRVyo7GgSHFzdiaKvBt5RJ8C5Fo_22r0g/viewform).

### How can I change my password?

Read [here](https://support.google.com/accounts/answer/41078?hl=en\&co=GENIE.Platform%3DDesktop).

### What is a personal email vs. a group email?

Read on [here](/broken/pages/-Lw2zd-XTIq3EY0T9e29#personal-accounts-vs.-group-accounts).

### I don't get the emails of my local chapter (e.g. berlin@correlaid.org) in my personal inbox (e.g. leo.p@correlaid.org)?

This is intentional. While this might be annoying at first - having to switch between accounts - it has advantages:

* Transparency: when you answer an email from the shared inbox, other people with access can see the conversations. In contrast, if you answered an email to info@ or berlin@ from your personal inbox, the others could not see that.
* Clear lines: it's clear what is your personal business and what is business of the LC/group. For example, having a distinct personal inbox enables you to get _personal_ invitations to events/meetings.

### How can I access the emails of my local chapter (e.g. lc-jena@correlaid.org)?

Read [here](faq.md#google-workspace).

### I should have access to a group email (e.g. [konstanz@correlaid.org](mailto:konstanz@correlaid.org)) but I don’t see it when I go to [mail.google.com](http://mail.google.com)?! <a href="#i-should-have-access-to-a-group-email-eg-konstanzcorrelaidorg-but-i-dont-see-it-when-i-go-to-mailgoo" id="i-should-have-access-to-a-group-email-eg-konstanzcorrelaidorg-but-i-dont-see-it-when-i-go-to-mailgoo"></a>

You need to be logged into your personal Workspace account in order to see the group mail.\
Also try:

* logging out and back in of your account
* reloading gmail

### I have access to a group email (e.g. [konstanz@correlaid.org](mailto:konstanz@correlaid.org)) in the browser via this delegation thing. How do I get this on my smartphone or into my email client? <a href="#i-have-access-to-a-group-email-eg-konstanzcorrelaidorg-in-the-browser-via-this-delegation-thing-how" id="i-have-access-to-a-group-email-eg-konstanzcorrelaidorg-in-the-browser-via-this-delegation-thing-how"></a>

You don’t - at least not in a [not totally user-unfriendly way](https://support.google.com/mail/thread/80323090/how-can-i-access-my-delegated-gmail-email-on-my-mobile?hl=en). And it sucks! (picture Leo screaming into the void when he learnt about this).

This is why we share the credentials for the group account(s) you have access to with you via the [KeePass database files](https://docs.correlaid.org/wiki/infrastructure/password-management).

## Google Workspace

### What is a Google group and why is this important?

Read [here](faq.md#google-workspace)[.](infrastructure/google-workspace.md#what-is-a-google-group)

### What is a personal account vs a group account?

Both are normal Google Workspace user accounts. The distinction is conceptual and specific to CorrelAid:

* personal account: your own account in the CorrelAid Google Workspace. For example, phil.b@correlaid.org. Only you have access to this account. You can have a Google calendar for your CorrelAid volunteering, send/receive emails in your function as a CorrelAid volunteer (e.g. to communicate with project partners), collaborate on Google Drive, ...
* group account: an account which is mainly there for the purpose of collaboratively managing emails, i.e. collaborative inbox. For example, each chapter has a group account / email, e.g. konstanz@correlaid.org. The respective local chapter heads (e.g. members of `group-lc-konstanz-heads` Google Group) have access to the credentials of this account so that they can collaboratively manage the inbox of this email address.

### How do I migrate Google Docs/Sheet/Slides from my personal account?
