<summary>What is a <strong>personal account</strong> vs. a <strong>group account in Google Workspace</strong>?</summary>

Both are normal Google Workspace user accounts. The distinction is conceptual and specific to CorrelAid:

* personal account: your own account in the CorrelAid Google Workspace. For example, phil.b@correlaid.org. Only you have access to this account. You can have a Google calendar for your CorrelAid volunteering, send/receive emails in your function as a CorrelAid volunteer (e.g. to communicate with project partners), collaborate on Google Drive, ...
* group account: an account which is mainly there for the purpose of collaboratively managing emails, i.e. collaborative inbox. For example, each chapter has a group account / email, e.g. konstanz@correlaid.org. The respective local chapter heads (e.g. members of `group-lc-konstanz-heads` Google Group) have access to the credentials of this account so that they can collaboratively manage the inbox of this email address.
