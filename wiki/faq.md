## Everything seems to be on Slack! How do I get on there?

If you want to become part of our Slack, drop an email to [Frie](mailto:frie.p@correlaid.org) or [Regina](mailto:regina.s@correlaid.org). If you are already member of our Slack and would like to see your friend become part of the team, you can also [request an invite](https://slack.com/intl/en-de/help/articles/201330256-Invite-new-members-to-your-workspace#request-an-invitation) from within Slack. 

## Do you also have email? 

Yes, sure! You can find some of our contacts [on the website](https://correlaid.org/contact). Or in the answer to the question above. 😉
