## Everything seems to be on Slack! How do I get on there?

{% hint style="info" %}
If you want to become part of our Slack, drop an email to [Frie](mailto:frie.p@correlaid.org) or [Phil](mailto:phil.b@correlaid.org). If you are already member of our Slack and would like to see your friend become part of the team, you can also [request an invite](https://slack.com/intl/en-de/help/articles/201330256-Invite-new-members-to-your-workspace#request-an-invitation) from within Slack.
{% endhint %}

## Do you also have email?

{% hint style="info" %}
Yes, sure! You can find some of our contacts [on the website](https://correlaid.org/contact). Or in the answer to the question above. :wink:

{% endhint %}

#### I don't get the emails of my local chapter in my inbox?

#### How can I access the emails of my local chapter (e.g. lc-jena@correlaid.org)?

1. make sure you are in the `heads` group (e.g. `lc-konstanz-heads` ) of your chapter by going to [https://groups.google.com/my-groups](https://groups.google.com/my-groups). If you are not part of the group, ask one of the members if they can/want to add you. If the group does not have any members yet, ask Phil.&#x20;
2. If you are/have become a member, go to `08_vaults` Shared Drive: [https://drive.google.com/drive/u/0/shared-drives](https://drive.google.com/drive/u/0/shared-drives)&#x20;
3. Follow the instructions outlined [here](infrastructure/password-management.md#how-can-i-access-the-password-s).

## Google Workspace



### What is a Google group and why is this important?

Read [here](faq.md#google-workspace)[.](infrastructure/google-workspace.md#what-is-a-google-group)



### What is a personal account vs a group account?

Both are normal Google Workspace user accounts. The distinction is conceptual and specific to CorrelAid:

* personal account: your own account in the CorrelAid Google Workspace. For example, phil.b@correlaid.org. Only you have access to this account. You can have a Google calendar for your CorrelAid volunteering, send/receive emails in your function as a CorrelAid volunteer (e.g. to communicate with project partners), collaborate on Google Drive, ...
* group account: an account which is mainly there for the purpose of collaboratively managing emails, i.e. collaborative inbox. For example, each chapter has a group account / email, e.g. konstanz@correlaid.org. The respective local chapter heads (e.g. members of `group-lc-konstanz-heads` Google Group) have access to the credentials of this account so that they can collaboratively manage the inbox of this email address.&#x20;
