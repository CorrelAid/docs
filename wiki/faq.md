1. Go to your personal [Google Drive](https://drive.google.com) in the browser
2. Select the files you want to transfer to your CorrelAid Workspace account (you can select multiple files by holding Cmd respectively CTRL)
3. Right-click -> Share to add your personal Google Workspace account (e.g. frie.p@correlaid.org) as collaborator with editor rights.
4. Repeat the selection process and then right-click -> Share -> Click on "Editor" next to your CorrelAid Account -> Transfer Ownership.&#x20;
