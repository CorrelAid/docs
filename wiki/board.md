# Board

The members of the Executive Board are jointly responsible for the overall management of the association. The board consists of:

* Chair of the Board
* Deputy Chair of the Board
* Treasurer
* 4 Members of the Extended Board (responsible for projects, education, and community)

When electing board members, a FLINTA quota of at least 50% must be taken into account in accordance with the statutes.

### Working mode and Board Meetings

In accordance with the Articles of Association, the Executive Board meets at least once a quarter. At the beginning of its term of office, the Executive Board agrees on meeting dates for the year; the aim is to hold a monthly meeting on fixed weekdays and at fixed times. These meetings usually take the form of video conferences.

In accordance with the Articles of Association, the Executive Board has a quorum if at least half of the current members of the Executive Board, including the Chair or Deputy Chair, participate in the meeting. Resolutions within the Executive Board are passed by majority vote. In the event of a tie, the Chair or, alternatively, the Deputy Chair has the casting vote.

The minutes of the Executive Board meetings are public and available to all members upon request.

### Core Team Retreat

Once a year, our core team meets to review the year and plan internal projects for the upcoming months. All information about this will be announced in #core-general.
