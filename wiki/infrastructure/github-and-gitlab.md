# GitHub and GitLab

## GitHub

We use GitHub for version control of most of our projects, both internal and with non-profit organizations. You can find our organization [here](https://www.github.com/CorrelAid).

There are different levels of permissions:

1. Members of the CorrelAid Core Team are **members** of the GitHub organization. Through the GitHub Team _coreteam_ , they have access to a lot of repositories (except of project repositories).
2. Some of the members of the organization are also **owners** of the GitHub organization. That means that they can delete and manage repositories, invite new members etc. (see [GitHub help](https://help.github.com/en/articles/repository-permission-levels-for-an-organization))
3. Everyone else - project team members, "temporary" core team members, external collaborators are added as **collaborators** with read/write access to the relevant repositories they need access to. They are **not** added to the GitHub organization. From the GitHub help:

> Outside collaborators: Repository collaborators can include organization members or outside collaborators. An outside collaborator is a person who has access to one or more organization repositories but is not explicitly a member of the organization, such as a consultant or temporary employee. ([https://help.github.com/en/articles/repository-permission-levels-for-an-organization](https://help.github.com/en/articles/repository-permission-levels-for-an-organization))

## GitLab

We also have a GitLab organization: [https://gitlab.com/correlaid](https://gitlab.com/correlaid).

However, we currently do not use it for much. If you want to work with GitLab in your project for any reason, we can also host the project repository there. No problem. :slight\_smile:
