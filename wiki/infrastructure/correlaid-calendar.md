# CorrelAid Calendar

We have a CorrelAid calendar to keep recurring meetings, core team calls, special events such as the meetup and events where we will be present. The calendar is mostly important for the CorrelAid employees to keep an overview over all core team activities but it can of course be referred to by everyone interested in all ongoing core team activities.

It is publicly accessible [here](https://outlook.office365.com/calendar/published/57caf27cdaf24aa3990ca496bd154ded@correlaid.onmicrosoft.com/e9bfdffe05e9417e9ecbb7b9d3168b4215317299690507860520/calendar.html). The ics file can be downloaded [here](https://outlook.office365.com/owa/calendar/57caf27cdaf24aa3990ca496bd154ded@correlaid.onmicrosoft.com/e9bfdffe05e9417e9ecbb7b9d3168b4215317299690507860520/calendar.ics).

The calendar is curated by the three CorrelAid employees Nina, Frie, and Isabel. If you want to add a call or event yourself, please contact them over Slack.
