# CorrelAid Calendar

We have a CorrelAid calendar to keep recurring meetings, core team calls, special events such as the meetup and events where we will be present. 

In addition to the "global" calender, some local chapters maintain their own calendar. All calendars are hosted on the [CorrelCloud](correlcloud.md) and can be read and edited by people who have an account there \(for CorrelAidX chapters, write access might be restricted to certain people\). In addition, some are shared publicly:
