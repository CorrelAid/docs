Azure has to be renewed every year (around February). We will receive instructions one month before expiry to info@correlaid.org (see FAQs).

## DNS management

DNS records are managed through Hetzner. Jonas or Frie can help you when you need to have a subdomain such as obs.correlaid.org pointing at your project / site or other DNS records (A, MX, CNAME, ...).
