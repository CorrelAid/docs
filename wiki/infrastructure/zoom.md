## Google Meet

Through Google for Nonprofits, CorrelAid has access to premium Google Meet features. Those include up to 100 participants, breakout rooms, whiteboards, and many more. [See here](https://www.google.com/nonprofits/workspace/compare/) for an overview. If you need to record a meeting (e.g. a meetup), you need to use Zoom instead.

If you have a [Google Workspace](google-workspace.md) account, you can create Meets by going to [https://meet.google.com](https://meet.google.com). Alternatively, you can directly add Google Meets to calendar events you create in your personal [CorrelAid calendar](google-workspace.md#personal-calendar).

## Zoom

CorrelAid has Zoom pro licenses. If you want to have a link for an event, please contact our [community management](mailto:community@correlaid.org).

### Recording a Zoom event

Sometimes, you might want to record a Zoom event. Here are our recommendations to keep the identities of the participants out of the recording:

* the speaker should share their screen
* host: switch to speaker view (**not** gallery)
* host: use the **spotlight** feature to spotlight the speaker and the moderator (typically the host functions as the moderator)
* with this setup...
  * participants can ask questions without appearing in the recording
  * the host can have the chat open overlaying the zoom recording -> this is independent of the recording feature

### Creating a Zoom event

1\) Schedule the meeting

<div data-full-width="false" data-with-frame="true"><figure><img src="../../.gitbook/assets/image (6) (1).png" alt="" width="375"><figcaption></figcaption></figure></div>

2\) Edit information: Date and time, further options (e.g. waiting room), etc.

<div data-with-frame="true"><figure><img src="../../.gitbook/assets/image (1) (1) (1) (1) (1).png" alt="" width="375"><figcaption></figcaption></figure></div>

3\) Copy Meeting Information

### Hosting a Zoom event

If you host a Zoom event for CorrelAid, you can use this background:

If you specifically host a CorrelLAB event, you can use one of these backgrounds (pink: "Daten verstehen", blue: "Daten nutzen", violet: General):

<div><figure><img src="../../.gitbook/assets/CorrelLAB-Kurs Daten verstehen.png" alt=""><figcaption></figcaption></figure> <figure><img src="../../.gitbook/assets/CorrelLAB-Kurs Daten nutzen.png" alt=""><figcaption></figcaption></figure> <figure><img src="../../.gitbook/assets/CorrelLAB Allgemein.png" alt=""><figcaption></figcaption></figure></div>

If you are the host of a session, you have additional functions. Find all of them [official Zoom documentation](https://support.zoom.com/hc/de/article?id=zm_kb\&sysparm_article=KB0065177). The host functions are displayed at the bottom of the screen, when you are not currently sharing your screen.

* **Participants**: Opens the window for managing participants, where you can add them to or remove them from the meeting or mute everybody.
* **More**:
  * **Survey**: Allows you to create, edit, and launch surveys inside of Zoom.
  * **Breakout rooms**: Starts breakout rooms.&#x20;
* **Host tools**: Here you can (dis-)activate a waiting room or allow participants to share their screen.
