## Google Meet

Through Google for Nonprofits, CorrelAid has access to premium Google Meet features. Those include up to 100 participants, breakout rooms, whiteboards, and many more. [See here](https://www.google.com/nonprofits/workspace/compare/) for an overview. If you need to record a meeting (e.g. a meetup), you need to use Zoom instead.&#x20;

If you have a [Google Workspace](google-workspace.md) account, you can create Meets by going to [https://meet.google.com](https://meet.google.com). Alternatively, you can directly add Google Meets to calendar events you create in your personal [CorrelAid calendar](google-workspace.md#personal-calendar).&#x20;

## Zoom

CorrelAid has two Zoom pro licenses. If you want to have a link for an event, please contact either Frie or Nina or Phil depending on the area your event will fall into:

* Account 1 - education and projects: Frie + Nina
* Account 2 - CorrelAidX: Phil

### Recording a Zoom event

Sometimes, you might want to record a Zoom event (for example, a [OODM](../../correlcollection/oodm.md) or a workshop of the project cycle). Here are our recommendations to keep the identities of the participants out of the recording:

* the speaker should share their screen
* host: switch to speaker view (**not** gallery)
* host: use the **spotlight** feature to spotlight the speaker and the moderator (typically the host functions as the moderator)
* with this setup...
  * participants can ask questions without appearing in the recording
  * the host can have the chat open overlaying the zoom recording -> this is independent of the recording feature
