# Zoom

CorrelAid has two Zoom pro licenses. If you want to have a link for an event, please contact either Frie or Nina or Isabel depending on the area your event will fall into:  

* Account 1 - education and projects: Frie + Nina
* Account 2 - CorrelAidX: Isabel 



### Recording a Zoom event

Sometimes, you might want to record a Zoom event \(for example, a [OODM](../../correlcollection/oodm.md) or a workshop of the project cycle\). Here are our recommendations to keep the identities of the participants out of the recording:

* the speaker should share their screen 
* host: switch to speaker view \(**not** gallery\)
* host: use the **spotlight** feature to spotlight the speaker and the moderator \(typically the host functions as the moderator\)
* with this setup...
  * participants can ask questions without appearing in the recording
  * the host can have the chat open overlaying the zoom recording -&gt; this is independent of the recording feature
