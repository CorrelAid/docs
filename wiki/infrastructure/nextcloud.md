# NextCloud



## NextCloud / Storage Share

Starting April 2023, we have a so called Storage Share at Hetzner. This is the NextCloud offering of Hetzner.&#x20;

The instance is on [https://cloud.correlaid.org](https://cloud.correlaid.org)

### Groups&#x20;

NextCloud has groups like Google Workspace. We aim to mirror the structure of the [Google Groups](google-workspace.md#google-groups-users) in Google Workspace on NextCloud. They are called the same, except for the `group` prefix: so, `group-ethics-committee` is `ethics-committee` on NextCloud.&#x20;

While we have separate groups for the heads of each group in Google Workspace, we don't have this on NextCloud as there are far fewer groups and people active on there. Instead, people who are `heads` on Google Workspace will be [group admins](https://docs.nextcloud.com/server/latest/admin\_manual/configuration\_user/user\_configuration.html#granting-administrator-privileges-to-a-user) of their NextCloud groups.&#x20;

> Group administrators have the rights to create, edit and delete users in their assigned groups. Group administrators cannot access system settings, or add or modify users in the groups that they are not **Group Administrators** for.&#x20;

### Manage people to the group you're admin of

1. Go to [https://cloud.correlaid.org/settings/users](https://cloud.correlaid.org/settings/users)&#x20;
