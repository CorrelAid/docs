* We host a metabase instance at [https://mtbs.correlaid.org/](https://mtbs.correlaid.org/)
* We use this instance for creating monitoring dashboards for infrastructure and for internal and external reporting on various metrics related to CorrelAids work
* Should you need access to any dashboards or would like to use Metabase in a project, ask in the slack channel #infrastructure-correlbase
* This channel also serves as a communication channel to announce maintenance for this service and to ask general questions
