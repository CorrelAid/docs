# Directus (Content Management System)

The CorrelAid Content Management System (CMS) is a tool built with Directus that serves content to the CorrelAid website. All the content on the CorrelAid website, including blog posts, events, and projects, originates from the CMS. This documentation provides an overview of how to use the CMS and explains the process of managing and publishing content on the website.

**Accessing the CMS**

To access the CorrelAid CMS, visit `cms.correlaid.org` in your web browser.

If you need an account to contribute to correlaid.org, please reach out to the "infrastructure-website-cms" channel on the CorrelAid Slack.

**General Contribution Process**

To manage and publish content on the CorrelAid website, follow these general steps:

1. **Login:** Visit `cms.correlaid.org` and log in using your account credentials.
2. **Navigate to the desired collection:** Use the navigation menu to select the collection where you want to manage content, such as "Posts" or "Events."
3. **Create a new entry:** Click on the "New Entry" button to create a new content entry within the selected collection. Fill in the required fields and provide relevant information.
4. **Publish an entry:** When you're ready to make an entry live on the website, ensure that the entry is set to "published".
5. **Save and review changes:** After making edits or creating a new entry, remember to save your changes.
6. **Preview your changes:** Visit `correlaid.pages.dev` and enter your correlaid.org email address. You will then be sent a link containing a code that you can use to access the preview website. If you don't have a correlaid.org email, request a Google Workspace by asking Frie on Slack.

**Website Update Process**

The CorrelAid website is automatically updated at 1 am. To ensure that your content appears on the website, follow these guidelines:

1. **Set entries to "published":** To include an entry on the website, set its status to "published".
2. **Check preview:** Before the automatic update, preview your entries to verify how they will look on the website. This step allows you to make any necessary adjustments before the website update occurs.

Please note that the automatic update process may take some time, and the changes may not be immediately visible on the website.
