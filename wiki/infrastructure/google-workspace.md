## Migration

As questions / information regarding the migration to Google Workspace are only temporarily useful, they can be found in [this pad](https://pad.correlaid.org/s/B11wgILu9).

## Get started&#x20;

## User Management/Admin

### For CorrelAidX chapters

## Google Drive

### Get started

1. Go to [https://drive.google.com](https://drive.google.com) and make sure you are logged into your CorrelAid Google Workspace account.
2. This will redirect you to your "My Drive". There are three ways to interact with Google Drive which are accessible via the sidebar on the left:
   1. :warning:My Drive: your personal Drive. It shows the most recent documents you worked on and gives you the option to create new files. Do not create files here unless they are really just for you - they will not be shared with anyone by default.&#x20;
   2. :white\_check\_mark: Shared Drive: The shared drive system where people have access to files relevant to them. If you create/edit/delete files here, your teammates can directly access them as well. The shared drive system replaces NextCloud (with **exceptions for sensitive project data**, see below).&#x20;
   3. :white\_check\_mark: Priority: a new way of creating your own personal "view" of what is in Shared Drives. You can "pin" documents and sort them into workspaces - which won't affect the way things are organized in Shared Drive. You can use this freely as you like. Just remember: this is just for you.
3. Go to Shared Drives and explore. You should have access to the [`00_assets` drive](https://drive.google.com/drive/u/0/folders/0AFVtSXmGUxMCUk9PVA) where you can find template slides, the CorrelAid logo and other useful templates and documents.&#x20;
4. Setting up a local chapter? There is a suggestion for how to structure your local chapter folder in the `99_example_chapter`. Copy-paste that to your own chapter folder to get going!

### What (not) to store on Google Drive&#x20;

#### Data4Good Projects

:white\_check\_mark: You can keep on the Google Drive:

* meeting minutes unless it's very sensitive
* additional material such as certificates of attendance or data privacy agreements
* use Google Drive to transfer/store Open Data
* use Google Drive to transfer/store non-GDPR relevant data from the partner organization under the condition that the project partner **explicitly consented** to this

****:x:**You must not:**

* store project data from NPO partners if it is GDPR relevant
* store any other project data from NPO partners

### Guidelines & Best Practices

#### Avoid link sharing when possible

* :white\_check\_mark: Copy the link from the browser line and share with your team. They should be able to open the document because they have access to the Shared Drive folder where you put the file.&#x20;
* :x:Avoid sharing the document via the "Share" button, especially changing permissions from Restricted to something more permissive. If you find yourself repeatedly sharing files via the Share functionality with the same people, consider requesting Google Workspace accounts for them instead.
* :warning:Of course, sometimes it makes sense to share documents via the "Share" functionality, e.g. with an outside partner (partner organization, guest speaker, ...). In that case, you have to:
  * Click the "Share" button
  * Click on "Get Link"
  * Change "Restricted" to "Anyone with the link" (for outside people) or "CorrelAid e.V." (e.g. for internal memos)

#### Use Shared Drives instead of My Drive

Files in MyDrive are not shared in the Shared Drive system, so other people won't be able to access them. This hinders collaboration. Hence, make sure to always create new documents from a Shared Drive location/folder.&#x20;

### Migration

See the [Migration pad](https://pad.correlaid.org/s/B11wgILu9#file-migration-1) for questions & answers related to the Migration from Nextcloud / personal Google docs to Google Drive.

## Google Forms

### Events / Signup and Feedback forms

Due to GDPR concerns, please avoid using Google Forms for anything requiring a sign up/personal data. Instead use:

* Pretix for events -> Frie or Phil can give you access
* [KoboToolbox](kobo.md) for forms such as feedback surveys or signup for internal events (e.g. a summer party) -> Frie or Phil can give you access

## Google Mail



## Google Calendar



## Google Meet&#x20;
