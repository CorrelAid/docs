### Advanced Session: Data Visualization

#### Building a modularized Shiny App with {golem} and htmlwidges \(Cédric Scherer\)

In this talk, Cédric introduces you to modularized Shiny apps and a library called {golem} that simplifies the process. He will also give an overview of html widgets that are useful for designing your app and allow for interactive charts and an overall nice user experience. He is going to demonstrate the possibilities using our Shiny app from the LC Berlin that recently won the CorrelAidX challenge.

#### Reproducible Data Availability Visualization with Github Pages \(Lisa Reiber\)

An unfamiliar dataset or a 500-piece puzzle have \(at least\) one thing in common: in the beginning it is hard to find the things you are looking for. While codebooks with metadata usually provide a first overview on available sample sizes, they also tend to be dry and boring matters. Let’s make metadata easier on the eye. In her talk, Lisa will show you how she used RMarkdown and GithubPages to visualize the data availability for some of the Socio-Economic Panel data. The website is reproducible and helped her collaborators who were not familiar with the data to get started with the research design quickly, because it was easy to find out which variables would be suitable for analysis to begin with.

#### Visual narratives to connect: data visualization for and with people \(Federica Fragapane\)

As information designer, I constantly explore the possibilities that designing a piece opens in terms of creation of a connection with the people. A constant visual experimentation has a significant role in such research.During the talk I’ll show the process behind a set of data visualizations with a common ground of interest for the relationship between designer and people: not only as readers, but also as narrators. I’ll share the design phases and the lessons learnt throughout the processes.

### Advanced Session: Data Engineering

#### Data Engineering in Google Spreadsheets with Google Script \(Ilja Sperling\)

Spreadsheets are an entry drug to data but can become messy real quick - especially when at scale. For robust data outputs we need clean and structured data. But how to get there without a 500$ Tableau team subscription? JavaScript \(and Metabase\) to the rescue! Ilja will walk us through his journey of low-Budget data engineering with Google Apps Script, R, and the Google Spreadsheet API.

#### Building Individual Data Products for Social Good with Python, PostgresQL and Vue.js \(Jan Dix\)

Jan from cause&effect will share how they use open source technologies to build individual data products. His motto: Don’ t be MEAN, use PPV.

#### AutoML in the wild \(Gesa Müller\)

Gesa will share insights into her job at Gpredictive where she uses technologies like Spark and Scala to build automated data pipelines.

### Advanced Session: Modelling

#### DISH-O-TRON: A fun experiment to build your own AI product \(Marcel Mikl & Oli Moser\)

Solving real-world problems with AI often times starts with the realization that there is no data available.In this talk we will show how we tackled the problem of 'mysteriously appearing dirty dishes in the community kitchen sink' by building an AI-system from scratch. You can read more about the DISH-O-TRON [here](https://blog.codecentric.de/en/2020/09/dish-o-tron-no-more-dirty-dishes-ai/).

#### Using machine learning to detect anomalies in beehives \(Alexander Goncharskiy, Diren Senger, Alexandros Melemenidis\)

Bees are crucial for the preservation of life on earth in its current form. We helped taking bee observation and research to the next step by making sensor data usable and building an alarm system that alerts beekeepers in case of emergencies. Diren and Alexander will share how they trained machine learning models for anomaly detection.

#### The political discourse on discrimination: analysing 70 years of the Bundestag \(Alexandra Wörner\)

As the German constitution states, the sittings of the Bundestag need to be public which is why the plenary protocols are openly accessible. These massive amounts of text which have accumulated over70 years are not manageable anymore without machine assistance. Taking the example of discrimination, we are going to look into which insights we can derive using several techniques from Natural Language Processing.

### Advanced Session: Geospatial Data

#### Introduction to Geodata in R \(Michael Matiu\)

Michael will give an introduction into fundamentals of spatial data and introduction into basic R packages for spatial data.

#### \#30daymapchallenge: \(a little less than\) 30 different ways to create interactive maps with R \(Alexandra Kapp\)

Alex will share an exclusive preview of her results for the [\#30daymapchallenge](https://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=%2330daymapchallenge). Each day is dedicated to an idea or a package about maps: Using Deck.gl in R, viz of most used pathways, getting OSM data straight into R with a single line of code, creating 3D maps, draggable polygons in leaflet, origin destination flows, voronoi maps, etc

#### Introduction to PostGIS: PostgreSQL going spatial \(Malte Kyhos\)

Spatial data is often encountered in the form of flat files, such as shapefiles. However, the integration of such data into relational databases may offer several advantages in complex scenarios. In this talk,Malte will provide a brief introduction and overview to PostGis, a spatial extension for PostgreSQL.
