Data in the social sector is often still synonymous with impact measurement. In this topic session, we will discuss how to make the social sector and policies more efficient and effective using data by both enabling data-driven decision-making and completely rethinking processes by using data and tech. We will also talk about dangers and pitfalls of using data.

Speakers: Johannes \(CorrelAid e.V.\), Igor \(Phineo\), Moderator: Nina \(CorrelAid e.V.\)

#### Education: What makes a good data scientist?

{% embed url="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FrhQUBaLyCM" %}



The field of data science is broad: Job descriptions refer to data analysts, data scientists and data engineers and the list of technologies is growing fast. For young professionals, it is difficult to navigate the field. In this topic session, we aim to answer questions related to building a career in data science: ‘Which career paths are open to young professionals and how do they differ? Which key characteristics does a professional working in data possess? Which programming languages should prospective applicants focus on? Which technologies are in high demand? What are the go-to sources to stay ahead of current developments in tech?’ Get insights to answer your own questions in the 30min moderated discussion starting from 2PM.’

Speakers: Joseph \([DataQuest](https://dataquest.io)\), Oleg \([NextRound.cc](http://nextround.cc/)\), Moderator: Isabel \(CorrelAid e.V.\)

#### Careers: Real Careers in Data Science

Sometimes finding a career is done by speaking to the people who already built it: Listen to members of our community present the variety of careers that can be found in data and listen to how they decided and succeeded on their respective paths. Some but not all examples include: Data journalism, research, tech companies...

Speakers: Yannik, Sylvi, Damon \(CorrelAid e.V.\), Moderator: Manuel \(CorrelAid e.V.\)

### Beginner session: Introduction to R

The R workshop gives an introduction to base R covering functions to handle and visualize different variable types \(bar and pie plots, scatterplots, histograms\). In the second part, we look at more advanced plots\(different visualization for different groups of respondents\) and briefly cover the estimation and visualizationof linear regression models. It would be nice if everyone had R and RStudio installed \(both are freely available under [http://www.cran.r-project.org/](http://www.cran.r-project.org/) and [http://rstudio.org/download/desktop\).](http://rstudio.org/download/desktop%29.Speaker)

#### Reproducible Data Availability Visualization with Github Pages \(Lisa Reiber\)

{% embed url="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CzH\_FjMTrFU" %}



An unfamiliar dataset or a 500-piece puzzle have \(at least\) one thing in common: in the beginning it is hard to find the things you are looking for. While codebooks with metadata usually provide a first overview on available sample sizes, they also tend to be dry and boring matters. Let’s make metadata easier on the eye. In her talk, Lisa will show you how she used RMarkdown and GithubPages to visualize the data availability for some of the Socio-Economic Panel data. The website is reproducible and helped her collaborators who were not familiar with the data to get started with the research design quickly, because it was easy to find out which variables would be suitable for analysis to begin with.

#### Visual narratives to connect: data visualization for and with people \(Federica Fragapane\)

As information designer, I constantly explore the possibilities that designing a piece opens in terms of creation of a connection with the people. A constant visual experimentation has a significant role in such research.During the talk I’ll show the process behind a set of data visualizations with a common ground of interest for the relationship between designer and people: not only as readers, but also as narrators. I’ll share the design phases and the lessons learnt throughout the processes.

### Advanced Session: Data Engineering

#### Data Engineering in Google Spreadsheets with Google Script \(Ilja Sperling\)

{% embed url="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s27ct0apBv4" %}



Spreadsheets are an entry drug to data but can become messy real quick - especially when at scale. For robust data outputs we need clean and structured data. But how to get there without a 500$ Tableau team subscription? JavaScript \(and Metabase\) to the rescue! Ilja will walk us through his journey of low-Budget data engineering with Google Apps Script, R, and the Google Spreadsheet API.

#### The political discourse on discrimination: analysing 70 years of the Bundestag \(Alexandra Wörner\)

{% embed url="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bJBkZQ1xeA0" %}



As the German constitution states, the sittings of the Bundestag need to be public which is why the plenary protocols are openly accessible. These massive amounts of text which have accumulated over70 years are not manageable anymore without machine assistance. Taking the example of discrimination, we are going to look into which insights we can derive using several techniques from Natural Language Processing.
