# Finding partners

As Core Team, we want to minimize the hurdles to initiate local groups on your own. While we propose the roles "Project Coordination" and "Community Management" \(see [Role Definition](../role-definitions.md)\), this is not a prerequisite for calling yourself a CorrelAidX chapter. Neither is being registered in a particular legal form, e.g. as a registered association \(although this might become relevant once you grow\). Instead, we believe it is best that you find a way of getting your CorrelAidX chapter started that fits best to your environment. Especially in the beginning it might be difficult to get rooms and get into planning of your events. Setting your chapter up in a clever way might help with that. For example:

* If you are in a university context, you could register your chapter as a university group / club or associate it with a department student council or another existing university group / club. University clubs / groups can most often book university rooms for free, they can be part of student fairs etc. Student councils can help you with reaching your target audience via email lists, room booking and general communication. Local chaupters that went this route are 
* If you are not in a university context, try to find organizations to collaborate with. Maybe you can give a talk at a local R / Python user group meetup about data-for-good. Maybe there are open data or civic tech groups in your area. Another perk of connecting with them: Existing meetup groups most likely will know where to find rooms / locations for your own meetups. 
* Ask your employer! If you work in IT, most companies will generally sponsor meetups and provide space for them. Before you associate CorrelAid with your employer, please check back with the Core Team \(see [Contact](../contact.md)\). 
* If none of the previous approaches is available to you, we will figure it out together! 💪 Don't get discouraged.
