# PR activities

### Social Media - Instagram, LinkedIn & Twitter

If you have events / updates or exciting information to share please send them to the [\#pr-posts](https://correlaid.slack.com/archives/C022H164LNN) slack channel with the following information:

* Title
* short description
* if possible a picture
* if applicable twitter handles of speakers / organisations.

Our PR team will then share your content on **Instagram** and **LinkedIn** and Frie can send a **tweet** for you.

### Newsletter

If you would like to send out one of your events via the newsletter, please contact [Phil](mailto:phil.b@correlaid.org) with the event details. Either we include it in our monthly newsletter, which is sent out in the penultimate or last week of the previous month and goes to the whole network, or we share the information individually with the network / your local chapter audience.

### [Website Event Section](https://correlaid.org/events/)

We are also happy to post your events on the Event Section of our website. Just write to [Frie](mailto:%20frie.p@correlaid.org) or [Phil](mailto:phil.b@correlaid.org).
