# Data dialogue

## Goal: Offer NPOs that do not yet have a concrete project idea a format to define their data challenge with dedicated data scienctist volunteers.

## Key Takeaways:

* NPO: 

  1\) Learn how to think about data challenges \(through onboarding and scoping\)

  2\) Identify potential of data science for organizational challenges

  3\) Gather possible solutions for data challenges that can lead to an implementation project

* Data Scientists:

  1\) Learn how to scope projects \(project managers\)

  2\) Ideate on how to solve social challenges with data science

  3\) Win the pitch and join the project team - if they wish to do so

## Commitment

* NPO \(4h\):
  * Preparation of needed material \(1h\)
  * Preparation call and contact survey \(1h\)
  * Ideation session \(1h\)
  * Pitch night \(1h\)
* Data Scientist\(4-8h\)
  * Preparation of ideation session \(1h\)
  * Ideation session \(1h\)
  * Pitch creation phase \(1-4h over one week\)
  * Pitch night \(1h\)

## Roles

* Project managers: Coordinate onboarding, guide NPOs, train data scientists, launch projects
* Main moderator: welcome of guests, introduction of the orga team and of CorrelAid, guidance through the event

## Timeline

### Find partners

* Use public registrees or network associations or research NPOs in your region
* Contact NPOs using our e-mail template
* Assess whether interested NPOs have the same thematic topic and can join the same data dialogue

### Set time and date

* Set the time and date of the data dialogue \(ideation session and pitch night\) according to how NPOs may attend
* For offline events: Book possible locations
* For online events: Ask Frie Preu to set up a zoom environment
* Create/distribute marketing material \(Hint: PR \[PR \] \(mailto:pr@correlaid.org\) can help!\) or take a look in this [CorrelCloud file](https://correlcloud.org/index.php/s/cWRF8zWZjnRKRKn) 

### Organize

* Choose the following responsibilties: Moderator \(2P\), technical staff \(1P\)
* Train moderators using our internal guidances, for example with this [presentation](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1fM22bP0fVcKn98R4zB2Z8hhWup6XscoIJ-9L5i-bkBM/edit#slide=id.g884d5274fc_0_68)
* Set an agenda, create a presentation and gather necessary surveys

### Prepare partners

{% hint style="info" %}
Approach the organization and gain more insights in their data challenge, at the same time, they gain more insights on what information we need to tackle their challenge. It is not necessary to fully define the questions on challenges yet - here you can collect ideas and mark points for clarification during the ideation session.
{% endhint %}

### Prepare participants

* Transcribe the data to a call for application format to share with volunteers \(Hint: \[Frie \] \(mailto:frie.p@correlaid.org\) can help!\)
* Share invitation in the networks using this form
  * Event \(Facebook\)
  * CorrelAid distributor
  * Student distribution boards
* Monitor registrations \(we have a 50% attendance rate\)
* Assess abilities and prepare matching
* Send reminder e-mail one week before

### Ideation session \(1h\)

* Ideally, offer an onboarding session from project managers to volunteers in an hour
* Ideate on data challenges and solutions with broad focus \(collect as many ideas as possible\)
* Gather ideas on post-its or similar digital tools
* Let the NPO select up to 3 ideas that they want pitches on
* Form pitch teams using a zoom survey

### Pitch working phase \(1-4h over a week\)

* Pitch teams work on their pitch, incl. a technical proposal, value-add and ressource-time allocation
