# Doing a project

It is also possible to carry out projects at the local level via CorrelAid. However, it is important to us that the projects meet the criteria we set for our own projects. Hence, please make sure to check this guide when deciding on whether to do a project with a potential partner organisation:

{% page-ref page="../project-manual/project-decision-guide.md" %}

Also make sure to check out the [toolbox](../project-manual/toolbox.md) for more resources and the [project coordination subpages](../project-manual/project-coordinators/) for more information on how to organize your own project.
