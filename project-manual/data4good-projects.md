# CorrelAid Data4Good projects

Our Data4Good projects are at the core of our work. In our skilled volunteering projects, we connect data scientist volunteers from our network network of over 1300 volunteers with nonprofit organisations. Through the projects, our volunteers have the opportunity to apply their existing skills and gain new knowledge. At the same time, they support nonprofit organisations with solving their data-related challenges. Over 2-6 months and in teams from 2-7 data scientists, CorrelAid volunteers have tackled diverse data challenges of nonprofits: from data collection, data visualization and exploratory data analysis to automation, reporting and advanced statistical analyses using machine learning and deep learning techniques.

## Actors

Several actors are involved in a CorrelAid Data4Good project. Here is a small overview with the most important terminology.

## Project phases

A typical CorrelAid project goes through 6 stages. Those are sketched out here to give a high-level overview. More detailed content can be found in the rest of the manual.

#### First contact / Project acquisition

CorrelAid has come in contact with a potential partner organization / NPO:

* they've contacted us over email
* we have met them at an event
* we have approached them 
* someone else put us into contact with them

#### Ideation

The project coordinator has established communication with the organization. Together with the contact person\(s\) from the NPO, they figure out whether and if so, how CorrelAid volunteers could support the NPO with their data challenge. Based on this information, the project coordinator develops the project call for applications in close coordination with the contact person\(s\) of the NPO.

{% page-ref page="project-coordinators/ideation-finding-a-team.md" %}

#### Finding a team

The project coordinator sends out the call for applications via the newsletter and collects the applications. Once the application deadline has passed, the project coordinator looks for a selection committee who then select a team. 

{% page-ref page="project-coordinators/ideation-finding-a-team.md" %}

#### Onboarding

The project lead together with the project coordinator and the support of the relevant tool administrators sets up the project tooling and communication channels. The project coordinator together with the project lead and the NPO starts planning the kickoff.

{% page-ref page="project-coordinators/onboarding.md" %}

#### Kickoff

The kickoff marks the official start of the project. Here, the NPO, the project coordinator, the project lead and the project team come together for a weekend \(or an online event\) to get to know each other, learn more about the background of the project and plan the project.

{% page-ref page="project-coordinators/kickoff.md" %}

#### Project work 

The project team works on the project, with regular feedback loops with the organization. The project team leader leads the team as primus inter pares and is responsible for keeping the project running. From time to time, the team gives an update to the project coordinator to ensure that no problems exist and that the project is running smoothly. 

{% page-ref page="project-coordinators/project-work.md" %}



#### Handover

The project team hands over the finished analysis / visualization / .. to the NPO. 

{% page-ref page="project-coordinators/handover-workshop.md" %}



#### Follow-up

Feedback is collected by the project coordinator from both the NPO and the project team members.

ðŸŸ¨: optional / in reduced capacity

* $$^1$$ during the project work phase, the project coordinator regularly checks in with the project team to make sure everything is going smoothly. They are also available for support.
* $$^2$$ Ideally the project coordinator should find a project team lead during the ideation phase by directly asking people whether they'd be interested in the role. In this case, the team lead can be involved in the ideation and team selection processes.
