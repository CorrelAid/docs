# Project Acquisition

In the past, most CorrelAid projects did not require active project acquisition work: word of mouth and personal contacts have worked well in the past. That being said, especially in a CorrelAidX context, active project acquisition can be necessary and useful.

## CorrelAidX

### Cold calls vs. warm calls

In a "cold call" scenario, your first point of contact with the organization is via you contacting them directly. In contrast, "warm calls" are preceded by some previous form of contact, e.g. you met a representative of the NPO at a meetup. Warm calls typically work better.

### Templates

You can find some templates from CorrelAidX chapters on this page:
