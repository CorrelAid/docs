# Project coordination

Those pages contain information for project coordinators and project team leads. 

Project coordinators are most important at the first stages of a project, from the first contact of the organization with CorrelAid up until a team has been formed and it has started working. During the project work phase, the project coordinator gets updates from the project team to ensure that the project is running smoothly. After the project has been successfully implemented, the project coordinator is responsible for the follow-up with the organization and the project team.

The project lead / team lead typically gets involved from the team selection process onwards. They are part of the project team but also have some additonal responsibilities related to team coordination, communication with the NPO and other organizational tasks.
