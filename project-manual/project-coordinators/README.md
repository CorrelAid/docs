# For project coordinators

Those pages contain information for project coordinators. Project coordinators are most important at the first stages of a project, from the first contact of the organization with CorrelAid up until a team has been formed and it has started working. During the project work phase, the project coordinator gets updates from the project team to ensure that the project is running smoothly. After the project has been successfully implemented, the project coordinator is responsible for the follow-up with the organization and the project team.

## Project phases

A typical CorrelAid project goes through 6 stages. Those are sketched out here to give a first overview. More detailed content will follow. 

### First contact

We have had first contact with the organization:

* they've contacted us over email
* we have met them at an event
* we have approached them and are waiting for an answer
* someone else put us into contact with them

### Ideation

The project coordinator has established communication with the organization and is figuring out:

* what data do they have \(if any\)
* how can CorrelAid help them 
* is it realistic that CorrelAid can help them?
* what's the scope of the project 

Based on this information, the project coordinator develops the project call for applications in close coordination with the contact person\(s\) of the NPO.

At the end of this phase, the project coordinator sends the project call for applications over our Mailchimp email list.

### Finding a team / onboarding

The project coordinator collects the applications. Once the application deadline has passed, the project coordinator looks for 1-3 suitable people to join the selection committee and they arrange for a call to decide who should join the project team. 

The project coordinator sends out the confirmation and declination emails to the applicants and establishes a first communication channel for the team, e.g. by inviting them to Slack and creating a private channel. 

If possible: After finding a date with the project team, the project coordinator and the project team lead contact the NPO to organize the **kick-off workshop** where project team and NPO have the opportunity to meet and exchange about the project. 

### Project work 

The project team works on the project, with regular feedback loops with the organization. The project team leader leads the team as primus inter pares and is responsible for keeping the project running. From time to time, the team gives an update to the project coordinator to ensure that no problems exist and that the project is running smoothly. 

### Adjourning and Follow-up 

The project team hands over the finished analysis / visualization / .. to the NPO. Feedback is collected by the project coordinator from both the NPO and the project team members. 

### Finished / Lost 

If the project has been successfully conducted so far, the project is then finished. If we could not finish the project \(e.g. problems with the data, project team problems, we could not help the NPO\), it is declared to be "lost".
