# Project work

Your responsibilities during the project work phase:

* keep an eye on the slack channel to see whether the team is still active
* check in from time to time (\~every 4 weeks) in the slack channel to ask how things are going and/or whether they need any support
* keep an eye out for the team trainee. Are they active? do they get the support that they need? You can also individually check in with the person.
* update the issue in the [projects repository](/broken/pages/-M-oSWcFKWo2AjTyHIAI) from time to time with a comment
* If there are any problems, support the team lead, e.g. by facilitating a meeting with the NPO. You and the team lead can always get advice from Frie and/or the core team call on how to handle difficult situations.
