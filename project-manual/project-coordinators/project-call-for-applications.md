# Project call for applications

One of your central tasks as a project coordinator is drafting and sending out the project call for applications \(de: Projektausschreibung\) to our network. The call for applications is the central way how we announce our projects and how we collect applications from our network. 

## Drafting with CodiMD

During the [ideation](project-stages.md#ideation) phase, you should take notes \(best on our CodiMD instance [pad.correlaid.org](../../wiki/infrastructure/codimd.md)\) that summarize what you have discussed with the NPO in-person, or over email and/or phone. 

Once you have a clear idea of the scope and content of the project, you can start drafting the project call for applications on CodiMD. In order to make this as easy as possible for you, we provide [German](https://pad.correlaid.org/jnPmVZffSdWbWw3oQWN8_w?both) and [English](https://pad.correlaid.org/jnPmVZffSdWbWw3oQWN8_w?both) templates for this that closely mirror the structure of the Mailchimp template.

German or English? This depends on the project. To be as inclusive as possible, the English one should be the default. However, if your project will be in German only and it is _really_ not possible to participate without good German skills \(i.e. because of the nature of the data\), choose the German one.

Copy the content of the CodiMD into a new pad and rename it to reflect your project's name. Then you can start filling in the necessary information.

## Sending with Mailchimp

Once you're finished drafting your call for applications and have checked back with the organization to get a go-ahead, you can send it out to our network using our Mailchimp newsletter list. The following video shows how to do this:

## FAQ

### I want send the call to applications only to a local chapter. How can I do that?

Local chapters are stored in Mailchimp as segments of the CorrelAid Newsletter audience. When building your Mailchimp campaign, you can select a specific segment of the list. Check out [this part](https://youtu.be/wwQIBOydcV4?t=227) of the tutorial video.
