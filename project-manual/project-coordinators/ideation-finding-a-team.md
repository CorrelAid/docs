## Ideation

{% hint style="info" %}
**Relevant CorrelAid actors**

* project coordinator
* project lead \(if found early\)
{% endhint %}

#### **Goals**

1. decide **whether** we should do a project with the organization
2. if yes, scope the project

#### **Checklist**

{% hint style="success" %}
* [ ] add project to Kanban board
* [ ] talk to NPO
* [ ] decide to do project with NPO
* [ ] scope the project
* [ ] get information on data security / privacy & data access 
* [ ] fix date of the [kickoff workshop](kickoff.md#location) if possible \(especially when in-person\)
* [ ] if possible, find a prospective team lead and involve them early into the process
* [ ] confirm team members
* [ ] confirm team lead \(if you had to "promote" a team member\)
{% endhint %}

### Add project to Kanban Board

We have a Kanban board in GitHub to track the progress of all projects. Once you enter into more the ideation phase with a non-profit organisation, make sure to add it to the kanban board. This way, we have a global overview over all projects and you can also check out other projects and learn from their progress.

How to add your project to the Kanban board? Learn more on this page:

{% page-ref page="github-projects-repository.md" %}

### Communication Mode

In the ideation phase, you should aim to communicate regularly and repeatedly with the NPO to make sure that we a\) really want to do a project with them and b\) can define a project which will work for both the NPO and the CorrelAid team. Usually, **2-4 iterations over 1-4 weeks** are necessary to define a project so that we can send it out via our newsletter.

In principle, you are free in how you communicate with the NPO: email, phone, video call or in-person are all valid choices. However, aim for **at least one personal conversation** \(i.e. not email\). Ideally, you have a mix of personal formats with follow-up emails with a short protocol summarizing what you discussed on the phone, in the video call or in-person. This way you can make sure that you and the organization had the same take-aways from the call and that you have a written, agreed-upon record to come back to.

You can take notes on our CodiMD instance [pad.correlaid.org](../../wiki/infrastructure/codimd.md). You can copy the [ideation phase template](https://pad.correlaid.org/q8nnfNimT3Shj9_wUp-kvQ#) which includes a rough structure and some helpful questions \(see below\). If you note down very sensitive information in the process, consider changing the permission of the pad to "private" \(see [here](../../wiki/infrastructure/codimd.md#setting-permissions)\) or take notes offline.

There are several things you need to discuss with the NPO over the course of the ideation phase:

1. content and scope of the project 
2. expectation management & organization commitments 
3. data security / privacy & data access
4. timeline 
5. team size & composition

### Content and scope of the project

This is arguably the most interesting part. Here, you and the NPO should elaborate together what should be part of the project and how CorrelAid volunteers can help the NPO while at the same time having a good learning experience.

**What's a good CorrelAid project? When should we do a project? When not?**

Please refer to the guide to find out whether we should do a project in the first place.

{% page-ref page="../project-decision-guide.md" %}

{% hint style="warning" %}
Finding all this out might require a call with the potential partner, so don't make promises too early before you have established that this will be a good idea.
{% endhint %}

Hence, it is important to get as good a picture of the situation as possible. While this process is not standardized, here are some resources:

* a catalogue of possibly helpful questions can be found in the [ideation phase template](https://pad.correlaid.org/q8nnfNimT3Shj9_wUp-kvQ#question-collection).
* you can also draw from the data maturity framework from the [_Center of Data Science & Public Policy_](http://www.datasciencepublicpolicy.org/home/resources/datamaturity/). It has a "Data and Tech Readiness Scorecard" and a "Organizational Readiness Scorecard". They can be downloaded [here](http://www.datasciencepublicpolicy.org/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/Data_Maturity_Framework_4.28.16.pdf).
* we have adapted both scorecards into German. They can be downloaded [here](https://correlaid.org/material/datenreifegradmodell.pdf) and [here](https://correlaid.org/material/organisationsreifegradmodell.pdf).

{% hint style="warning" %}
While coming to an agreement on the content and scope of the project is important, you should leave enough room so that goals can be adjusted later on in the project if necessary. Avoid going into too much technical detail in the project description. Focus on **what** the organization needs and fix the rough technologies \(Python or R? Data Visualization or Machine Learning Model?\), and leave the more detailed **how** to the project team.
{% endhint %}

### Expectation management & Organization commitments

Another important part of the ideation phase is expectation management. You should make clear that:

* ... CorrelAid is a **volunteer-based organization**. That means that the project team members are volunteers who will usually spend 3-5 hours per week on the project. It also means that rarely volunteers might drop out of the project because they're suddenly faced with other, unforeseen challenges in their life. 
* ... CorrelAid projects **do not only serve the NPO but also our volunteers** by providing learning opportunites \(see info box above\). This also means that our project teams are diverse such that we do reserve at least one spot for a less experienced data scientist.

Fortunately, almost all NPOs will totally understand those points because they also rely on volunteering in their work. :\)

In addition to those "soft" expectation management issues, you should also get the OK from the organization that they are willing and able to:

* support the project team over the course of the project, i.e. they will be available for regular calls / email communication / meetings to answer questions and give feedback 
* provide a room for the [kickoff](kickoff.md) and pay for travel and accomodation for project team members. Those costs usually amount to ~500-1000 euro. If the kick-off workshop is virtual, they are willing to participate online. 

### Data privacy & data access

Data protection and privacy is very important to CorrelAid. Hence, you should find out early what kind of data is to be collected and/or analysed in the project so that the project lead and project team can take on appropriate measures to correctly store and process the data.

To make yourself familiar with the different types of data - especially the concept of "personal data" -, please check out the "[types of data](../data-security-and-privacy.md#types-of-data)" section of the data security & privacy page:

{% page-ref page="../data-security-and-privacy.md" %}

After you've familiarized yourself with the definitions, you should be able to decide on the right project setup together with the NPO by asking the following questions.

**Will any kind of personal data be involved in the project?**

**If** üëç**:**

Most of the times, CorrelAid teams will get a pseudonymized version of the data \(i.e. individuals are still identifiable with the use of additional information\). But even if the partner organization claims the data is truly anonymized, CorrelAid teams should not rely on that claim. Hence, in any case CorrelAid teams dealing with any kind of personal data should always adhere to the following setup:

{% hint style="info" %}
**Project setup**

* DO: encrypt the data on local machines \(see [howto](../data-security-and-privacy.md#data-encryption)\)
* DO NOT: upload data to GitHub / GitLab \(see howto\)
* DO: team members and NPO need to sign the _obligation to observe data secrecy_ _\*\*_\(de: Datenschutzverpflichtungserkl√§rung\) \(download it here\)
* DO \(if very sensitive data\): team members create separate user account on their machine just for the project
{% endhint %}

**If** üëé**:**

If the project does not involve personal data, it depends on the requirements and wishes of the NPO which data protection measures the project team needs to adopt. Here are the questions to ask the NPO.

#### **Does the data have to be encrypted locally?**

Make sure the organization understands the attack vector, i.e. if a laptop of a team member was stolen, the data could be extracted from the hard drive.

If data can be stored unencrypted, CorrelAid team members do not need to ensure encryption which can be easier, especially for team trainees.

**Can the data be uploaded to a private GitHub / GitLab repository?**

Make sure that the organization understands that GitHub and GitLab are both companies which most likely have their servers in the US. CorrelAid does not self-host a version control service.

With a private repository access to the repository would be limited to team members and the project coordinator. In consequence the data would only be accessible to team members and the project coordinator.

If data can be stored on GitHub / GitLab, they can be put under version control, i.e. changes to raw data can be tracked and reverted easily if necessary. In addition, it makes collaboration in the team easier because the setup is shared through GitHub / GitLab.

**Can the code and data be published to a public GitHub / GitLab repository?**

If the organization decides to open source the code and data to the public, it is accessible to everyone.

Other organizations and data scientists can make use of our work and we would contribute to open source.

If the NPO decides that they are ok with open sourcing code + data, you should help them choose a license for data and code. [https://choosealicense.com/](https://choosealicense.com/) is a good resource for deciding this.

| Question | Answer | Consequence |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| Can the data be stored unencryped on the local machines? | ‚úÖ | Team members _**do not need**_ _\*\*_to use VeraCrypt or encrypt their home folder. |
| Can the data be stored unencrypted on the local machines? | ‚ùå | Team members _**need**_ to use VeraCrypt or encrypt their home folder. |
| Can the data be uploaded to a private GitHub / GitLab repository? | ‚úÖ | Team members _**can**_ _**upload**_ raw and all kinds of processed data to GitHub / GitLab. The initial data transfer to the project team can be done using GitHub / GitLab. |
| Can the data be uploaded to a private GitHub / GitLab repository? | ‚ùå | Team members _**cannot**_ _**upload**_ raw and processed data to GitHub / GitLab. Instead, they should document relevant folder structures in the README of the repository and put the data folder in .gitignore. The initial data transfer to the project team _**needs**_ to be done via the CorrelCloud. |
| Can the code and data be published to a public GitHub / GitLab repository? | ‚úÖ | The repository _**can be public**_. Appropriate licences for code and data _**need**_ to be chosen. |
| Can the code and data be published to a public GitHub / GitLab repository? | ‚ùå | The repository _**cannot be public.**_ |

{% hint style="warning" %}
**Get written confirmation from NPO**

Always confirm what you discussed in in-person or in calls via a **clearly formulated email** with the NPO, e.g. by copying the table above with the answers of the NPO and asking for their written confirmation of the agreed privacy rules. You can store the email in the [CorrelCloud](onboarding.md#data-transfer-with-correlcloud) folder that you create later in the onboarding phase.
{% endhint %}

### Timeline

Finally, you should also agree on a rough **timeline**. A usual project can look like:

| Phase | Approximate Duration |
| :--- | :--- |
| _Send out call for applications_ |  |
| Collecting applications | 1.5-2 weeks |
| Team selection | 1 week |
| Onboarding + coordination of kickoff | 1-5 weeks |
| _Kickoff workshop_ | _either online \(1-3 hours\) or a in-person weekend_ |
| Project work | 1-6 months |
| _Handover workshop_ | _either online \(1-3 hours\) or a in-person meeting \(1-3 hours\)_ |
| Follow-up | immediately after handover workshop and after several months |

Please always add in a bit of buffer. Holidays etc. are a thing, so you shouldn't plan with all volunteers working 3-5 hours on the project all weeks.

{% hint style="info" %}
**Deadlines can be helpful!**

If the organization has a certain **deadline** \(e.g. the launch of a new website, their annual members meeting\), use it to mark the end of the project. This way, the project team has a clear goal to work towards!
{% endhint %}

### Team

A project needs a **team**. Before you send out the call for applications, you should define roughly how you would like the team to look like.

#### Size

Usually, CorrelAid teams consist of 4-6 people, but there can also be smaller teams \(e.g. a two-person team\) or larger teams if the project is very comprehensive and there are several sub-projects that can be worked on simultaneously.

{% hint style="warning" %}
**Team size - always overstaff!**

Previous experience has shown that there is usually a "loss" of 1-2 people over the course of a project. Hence, if in doubt whether you want `x` or `x+1` people on the team, rather go with `x+1`. **Rather overstaff than understaff!**
{% endhint %}

#### Roles

With regards to skills, it can be useful to think of different "roles" that you want to fill. In a typical CorrelAid project, there are **three types of team roles:**

* project lead / team lead: The project lead is a team member that has some additional responsibilities such as coordination of the team, being the primary contact person of the organization, and reporting back to the project coordinator \(aka you\). Usually, the project lead is also a more experienced data scientist who can help others with technical problems but this doesn't have to be the case. The project lead can also be someone who is very knowledgable and has high domain expertise. 
* team member: "regular" team member: upper beginner level, mid-level and experienced data scientists / data analysts.
* team trainee: at least one position in every CorrelAid project is reserved for less experienced data scientists who are just at the start of their data science journey. 

A usual CorrelAid project team looks like this:

* 1 project lead
* 2-4 team members
* 1 team trainee

Depending on the project, you can also define two project leads or team trainees, or have more "regular" team members.

#### Find a team lead early!

{% hint style="warning" %}
**When and how to find a team lead**

Ideally, you have the position of the team lead filled before sending out the call for applications. This way, they can participate in the team selection process and can already be involved in some communication with the NPO. In addition, if you know the team lead personally, they will probably be more committed to the project's success.

If you don't know anyone who could be a candidate, ask around in the core team whether someone knows someone who could be interested in the project. In CorrelAidX contexts, ask people who have attended several meetups / who you know personally.
{% endhint %}

## Call for Applications

{% hint style="warning" %}
**CorrelAidX projects**

In our Mailchimp newsletter, we have so-called _segments_ for all chapters, i.e. we can contact all CorrelAid members who are interested in activities of your CorrelAidX chapter. Usually, CorrelAidX projects should be sent out to this local newsletter list to give everyone in your area the chance to apply for the project.

However, if you are just starting out as a chapter and just acquired your first project, it is also possible to form a team out of the initial members of the chapter without sending the project over your local section of the newsletter. In this way, you can experience a CorrelAid project together and pass on your knowledge in later projects.
{% endhint %}

{% hint style="info" %}
**Relevant CorrelAid actors**

* project coordinator
* project lead \(if already found\)
{% endhint %}

#### Checklist

{% hint style="success" %}
* [ ] draft call for applications on CodiMD
* [ ] get approval for call for applications from NPO
* [ ] add project to kobotoolbox form
* [ ] send out call for applications to newsletter
* [ ] \(if necessary\), send out reminder to newsletter
{% endhint %}

### Draft the call for applications on CodiMD

Once you have decided together with the NPO that a project makes sense and you have a clear idea of the scope and content of the project, you can start drafting the call for applications \(de: Projektausschreibung\). The call for applications is the central way how we announce our projects and how we collect applications from our network.

You can draft the call for applications on CodiMD. In order to make this as easy as possible for you, we provide [German](https://pad.correlaid.org/jnPmVZffSdWbWw3oQWN8_w?both) and [English](https://pad.correlaid.org/jnPmVZffSdWbWw3oQWN8_w?both) templates for this that closely mirror the structure of the Mailchimp template that you'll use later to send it out to the network.

* üá©üá™ the [German template  ](https://pad.correlaid.org/jnPmVZffSdWbWw3oQWN8_w?both)
* üá¨üáß the [English template](https://pad.correlaid.org/jnPmVZffSdWbWw3oQWN8_w?both)

**Copy the content of the CodiMD into a new pad and rename it to reflect your project's name.** Then you can start filling in the necessary information. If you want the NPO to be able to review the document, you can set the permission to "editable".

{% hint style="info" %}
**German or English?**

This depends on the project. To be as inclusive as possible, the English one should be the default. However, if your project will be in German only and it is _really_ not possible to participate without good German skills \(i.e. because of the nature of the data\), choose the German one.
{% endhint %}

### Add project to KoboToolbox form

For project applications, we have a [Kobotoolbox form](https://ee.correlaid.org/x/8ZibAmdq) that we use for all projects. At the beginning of the survey, applicants are asked to select which project they want to apply to. Hence, you need to add your project to this sign-up form. In order to do so, please contact either Nina \(@Nina Hauser\), Isabel \(@Isabel Willmann\), or Frie \(@frie\) on Slack as they have access to Kobotoolbox.

### Send with Mailchimp

Once you're finished drafting your call for applications and have checked back with the organization to get a go-ahead, you can send it out to our network using our Mailchimp newsletter list. If you do not have access to Mailchimp, ask in \#projects for support. The following video shows how to do send out a project call for applications via Mailchimp:

{% hint style="warning" %}
this video is not up to date: the editing of the buttons is not necessary anymore because we now have the Kobotoolbox form.
{% endhint %}

{% embed url="https://youtu.be/wwQIBOydcV4" caption="" %}

{% hint style="info" %}
**How can I only send to a local chapter?**

Local chapters are stored in Mailchimp as segments of the CorrelAid Newsletter audience. When building your Mailchimp campaign, you can select a specific segment of the list. Check out [this part](https://youtu.be/wwQIBOydcV4?t=227) of the tutorial video.
{% endhint %}

## Team selection

{% hint style="info" %}
**Relevant CorrelAid actors**

* project coordinator
* project team lead \(if already found\)
* selection committee
{% endhint %}

#### **Goals**

1. find a diverse, capable team

#### Checklist

{% hint style="success" %}
* [ ] find a selection commitee 
* [ ] anonymize applications \(names, email adresses\) 
* [ ] share applications with committee
* [ ] team selection call
* [ ] confirm team members & send out rejection emails 
* [ ] confirm team lead
* [ ] invite team members to Slack channel 
* [ ] create [Git](../../wiki/infrastructure/github-and-gitlab.md) repository and invite members as collaborators
{% endhint %}

### Find a selection committee

After the call for applications is sent out to the network, you can start looking for a team selection committee. Usually a team selection committee consists of 3-4 members:

* the project coordinator\(s\)
* 1-2 people from the core team 
* the future team lead \(if available\)

The selection committee should be comprised so that gender parity is respected. In addition, it makes sense to include people with differing levels of experience. At least 1-2 of the members should be able to judge applications with regards to technical skills. People who have applied to the project cannot be part of the team selection committee.

You can find members for your committee by posting on Slack in \#general or \#projects. Best include some information about the project. For example:

> Do you want to be part of the team selection committee for \[PROJECT NAME\]? The project will be about training a model to do XX. It will be in Python.

### Application report

Once the deadline has expired, you should request the **anonymized application report** from Frie. They will share the anonymized data with you and the other team selection committee members as a HTML report. They will also share with you as the project coordinator the **mapping from the anonymized applicant ids to the email adresses** in a secure way so that you can later contact the applicants. We recommend not to look at those before making your selection to avoid any bias. 

{% file src="../../.gitbook/assets/2030-03-exa\_applications\_report.html" caption="Example report with fake data" %}

If your project is part of the project cycle, the report will also include information on what other projects the applicants applied to.

### Team selection call

Once you have found 2-4 people, arrange with them for a video call.

Everyone should have a look at the applications before the call so that decisions can be made quicker.

Team selection criteria:

* technical and statistical skills
* interest in topic / motivation for the project
* can the person learn something on the project?

One spot in the team is reserved for a "beginner".

**Principles of team selection:**

* no discrimination based on gender, gender identity and expression, sexual orientation, disability, mental illness, neuro\(a\)typicality, physical appearance, body size, age, race, ethnicity, nationality or religion.
* at least 50% of team seats are filled with applicants with genders currently underrepresented in tech \(currently everyone who's not a cisgender man; cisgender = people whose gender identity matches their sex assigned at birth\)
* applicants belonging to groups currently underrepresented in tech should be preferred whenever possible
* people who have unsuccessfully applied to a project in the past should be preferably considered whenever possible 
* people who apply for the first time should be preferably considered compared to people who have already participated in a project 
* unless in specific circumstances, interviews with applicants are not conducted 
* the selection committee tries to come to a consensus decision. If a consensus cannot be reached, the majority decides. If there is no majority, the project coordinator decides. 

{% hint style="info" %}
**Helpful guidelines: team roles**

When making a selection, the selection committee should aim to select people who have different areas of expertise so that they can help out each other. Here are some unofficial team "roles" that can be useful to think about when selecting team members \(they are not mandatory to fill, just a tool to help you think about the requirements of a project\):

* methods specialist: this is someone who has a high \(theoretical\) expertise in statistical and machine learning methods that are relevant to the project. They can give input when deciding on which model to use for specific use case. 
* programmer: they are quite experienced in the programming language used for the project and know different tooling and best practices that will help with code quality \(e.g. how to setup a Python project\). Ideally, this person is also quite good at git and can help other team members with merge conflicts and other git problems.
* domain specialist: this person already knows a lot about the domain of the project \(e.g. they've worked a lot with environmental data\). They can give valuable input about the intricacies of the problem at hand. 
* data wrangler: this person is quite good at and enjoys cleaning and wrangling all sorts of data. They can speed up the process in the beginning of the project to get to a state where  analysis / modelling / visualization can be done.

**Things to look for in all applications:**

* motivation: is the sole motivation the technical challenge? Ideally, project members should also be intrinsically motivated to help the NPO.
{% endhint %}

### Confirming team members

Before you send out rejection emails to all those applicants who were not selected for the team you should make sure that everyone is still interested in participating in the project. After all, 1-3 weeks might have passed since they applied and they could've changed their minds. You can use the acceptance email template to get the confirmation.

After everyone has confirmed their interest, you can send out the emails to the applicants who could not be considered. You can use the rejection email template to do this. If you want to send out multiple rejections at once, please make sure to **use blind copy** \(BCC\).

#### Acceptance Email

{% tabs %}
{% tab title="üá¨üáß" %}
Subject: \[CorrelAid\] Your application for the project "\[Project name\]"

{% tab title="üá¨üáß " %}
Subject: \[CorrelAid\] Your application for the project "\[Project name\]"

Dear \[name applicant\],

Thank you for your interest in participating in our project with \[Organisation\]. We were very happy about the applications we received. Unfortunately, the amount of applications \(there were \[number of applications\]\) meant that we had to make a selection.

Unfortunately you are not part of this project. You should not take this as a negative evaluation of your person or your skills. A variety of criteria played a role in our selection - we did not solely select the best-skilled applicants but aimed to put together a team with diverse experiences, skillsets and interests.

Of course, more projects are already in our pipeline and when making our selection, we also take into account whether analysts had unsuccessfully applied to a project in the past. So be sure to mention in your next application that you were not selected for this project. The next opportunity to work on a project will certainly come soon.

In the meantime, please feel free to contact me with questions and ideas at any time.

Best regards

\[Project coordinator\]
