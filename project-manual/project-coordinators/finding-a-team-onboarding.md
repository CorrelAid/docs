# Ideation / Finding a team / Onboarding

## Ideation

#### **Goals**

1. decide **whether** we should do a project with the organization
2. if yes, scope the project

#### **Checklist**

{% hint style="success" %}
* [ ] talk to NPO
* [ ] decide to do project with NPO
* [ ] scope the project
* [ ] get information on data security / privacy & data access 
{% endhint %}

### Communication Mode

In the ideation phase, you should aim to communicate regularly and repeatedly with the NPO to make sure that we a\) really want to do a project with them and b\) can define a project which will work for both the NPO and the CorrelAid team. Usually, 2-4 iterations over 1-4 weeks are necessary to define a project so that we can send it out via our newsletter.

In principle, you are free in how you communicate with the NPO: email, phone, video call or in-person are all valid choices. However, aim for at least one personal conversation \(i.e. not email\). Ideally, you have a mix of personal formats with follow-up emails with a short protocol summarizing what you discussed on the phone, in the video call or in-person. This way you can make sure that you and the organization had the same take-aways from the call and that you have a written, agreed-upon record to come back to.

You can take notes on our CodiMD instance [pad.correlaid.org](../../wiki/infrastructure/codimd.md). If you note down very sensitive information in the process, consider changing the permission of the pad to "private" \(see [here](../../wiki/infrastructure/codimd.md#setting-permissions)\) or take notes offline.

### Topics

There are several things you need to discuss with the NPO over the course of the ideation phase: 

1. content and scope of the project 
2. expectation management & organization commitments 
3. data security / privacy & data access
4. timeline & team

#### Content and scope of the project

This is arguably the most interesting part. Here, you and the NPO should elaborate together what should be part of the project and how CorrelAid volunteers can help the NPO while at the same time having a good learning experience.

{% hint style="info" %}
A good CorrelAid project is a win-win situation: our volunteers can apply and expand their knowledge and the NPO gets help with their data challenge. If you find out during the ideation process that the project would be extremely lop-sided in either direction, you can \(and probably should\) politely say no. Examples would be:

* a project which would only be "cool" for the volunteers, but there would be no real positive gain for the NPO. Every CorrelAid project should be of use to the partner organization. In this case, you could also do an internal project. 
* a project where CorrelAid volunteers would be used for free labor which is not rewarding in any way, e.g. a project consisting _only_ of mundane data entry tasks. Every CorrelAid project should entail opportunities to apply and learn useful data science skills. 
{% endhint %}

Hence, it is important to get as good a picture of the situation as possible. While this process is not standardized, here are some resources:

* a catalogue of possibly helpful questions can be found in the [ideation phase template](https://pad.correlaid.org/q8nnfNimT3Shj9_wUp-kvQ#question-collection).
* you can also draw from the data maturity framework from the [_Center of Data Science & Public Policy_](http://www.datasciencepublicpolicy.org/home/resources/datamaturity/). It has a "Data and Tech Readiness Scorecard" and a "Organizational Readiness Scorecard". They can be downloaded [here](http://www.datasciencepublicpolicy.org/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/Data_Maturity_Framework_4.28.16.pdf).
* we have adapted both scorecards into German. They can be downloaded [here](https://correlaid.org/material/datenreifegradmodell.pdf) and [here](https://correlaid.org/material/organisationsreifegradmodell.pdf).

{% hint style="danger" %}
While coming to an agreement on the content and scope of the project is important, you should leave enough room so that goals can be adjusted later on in the project if necessary. Avoid going into too much technical detail in the project description. Focus on **what** the organization needs and fix the rough technologies \(Python or R? Data Visualization or Machine Learning Model?\), and leave the more detailed **how** to the project team. 
{% endhint %}

#### Expectation management & Organization commitments

Another important part of the ideation phase is expectation management. You should make clear that:

* ... CorrelAid is a **volunteer-based organization**. That means that the project team members are volunteers who will usually spend 3-5 hours per week on the project. It also means that rarely volunteers might drop out of the project because they're suddenly faced with other, unforeseen challenges in their life. 
* ... CorrelAid projects **do not only serve the NPO but also our volunteers** by providing learning opportunites \(see info box above\). This also means that our project teams are diverse such that we do reserve at least one spot for a less experienced data scientist.

Fortunately, almost all NPOs will totally understand those points because they also rely on volunteering in their work. :\)

In addition to those "soft" expectation management issues, you should also get the OK from the organization that they are willing and able to:

* support the project team over the course of the project, i.e. they will be available for regular calls / email communication / meetings to answer questions and give feedback 
* provide a room for the kickoff and pay for travel and accomodation for project team members. Those costs usually amount to ~500-1000 euro. If the kick-off workshop is virtual, they are willing to participate online. 

#### Data security / privacy & data access

#### Timeline & Team



## Call for Applications

#### Goals

{% hint style="success" %}
* [ ] draft call for applications on CodiMD
* [ ] get approval for call for applications from NPO
* [ ] add project to surveymonkey dropdown question
* [ ] send out call for applications to newsletter
* [ ] \(if necessary\), send out reminder to newsletter
{% endhint %}

### Draft the call for applications on CodiMD

Once you have decided together with the NPO that a project makes sense and you have a clear idea of the scope and content of the project, you can start drafting the call for applications \(de: Projektausschreibung\). The call for applications is the central way how we announce our projects and how we collect applications from our network.

You can draft the call for applications on CodiMD. In order to make this as easy as possible for you, we provide [German](https://pad.correlaid.org/jnPmVZffSdWbWw3oQWN8_w?both) and [English](https://pad.correlaid.org/jnPmVZffSdWbWw3oQWN8_w?both) templates for this that closely mirror the structure of the Mailchimp template that you'll use later to send it out to the network.

* 🇩🇪 the [German template  ](https://pad.correlaid.org/jnPmVZffSdWbWw3oQWN8_w?both)
* 🇬🇧 the [English template](https://pad.correlaid.org/jnPmVZffSdWbWw3oQWN8_w?both)

{% hint style="info" %}
German or English? This depends on the project. To be as inclusive as possible, the English one should be the default. However, if your project will be in German only and it is _really_ not possible to participate without good German skills \(i.e. because of the nature of the data\), choose the German one.
{% endhint %}

**Copy the content of the CodiMD into a new pad and rename it to reflect your project's name.** Then you can start filling in the necessary information. If you want the NPO to be able to review the document, you can set the permission to "editable".

### Add project to surveymonkey form

For project applications, we have a [surveymonkey form](https://www.surveymonkey.de/r/correlaid_project_apply) that we use for all projects. At the beginning of the survey, applicants are asked to select which project they want to apply to. Hence, you need to add your project to this sign-up form. In order to do so, please contact either Nina \(@Nina Hauser\), Isabel \(@Isabel Willmann\), or Frie \(@frie\) on Slack as they have access to surveymonkey.

### Send with Mailchimp

Once you're finished drafting your call for applications and have checked back with the organization to get a go-ahead, you can send it out to our network using our Mailchimp newsletter list. If you do not have access to Mailchimp, ask in \#projects for support. The following video shows how to do send out a project call for applications via Mailchimp:

{% hint style="warning" %}
this video is not up to date: the editing of the buttons is not necessary anymore because we now have the surveymonkey form.

{% hint style="info" %}
**Sending only to a CorrelAidX Chapter**

Local chapters are stored in Mailchimp as segments of the CorrelAid Newsletter audience. When building your Mailchimp campaign, you can select a specific segment of the list. Check out [this part](https://youtu.be/wwQIBOydcV4?t=227) of the tutorial video.
{% endhint %}

## Team selection

#### **Goals**

1. find a diverse, capable team
2. onboard the team to Slack, GitHub etc.

#### Checklist

{% hint style="success" %}
* [ ] find a selection commitee 
* [ ] anonymize applications \(names, email adresses\) 
* [ ] share applications with committee
* [ ] team selection call
* [ ] confirm team members & send out rejection emails 
* [ ] invite team members to Slack channel 
* [ ] create [Git](../../wiki/infrastructure/github-and-gitlab.md) repository and invite members as collaborators
{% endhint %}

### Find a selection committee

After the call for applications is sent out to the network, you can start looking for a team selection committee. Usually a team selection committee consists of 3-4 members:

* the project coordinator\(s\)
* 1-2 people from the core team 
* the future team lead \(if available\)

The selection committee should be comprised so that gender partiy is respected. In addition, it makes sense to include people with differing levels of experience. At least 1-2 of the members should be able to judge applications with regards to technical skills. People who have applied to the project cannot be part of the team selection committee.

You can find members for your committee by posting on Slack in \#general or \#projects. Best include some information about the project. For example:

> Do you want to be part of the team selection committee for \[PROJECT NAME\]? The project will be about training a model to do XX. It will be in Python.

### Anonymization of applications

Once the deadline has expired, you should request the application data from either Nina, Frie or Isabel. They will share the data with you in a secure way, i.e. either via a password-protected CorrelCloud folder or an encrypted email.

You should then anonymize the data before sharing them with the team selection committee. In practice, this means:

1. create an csv \(or Excel file\) with two columns: a simple numeric id, and the email addresses of the applications. Keep this mapping on your local machine, do not share it with the committee
2. in the surveymonkey export, add the id column. 

### Share with the team selection committee

Share the _anonymized_ version with the project team. For that, we typically use a collaborative tool like Google Sheets or [cryptpad.fr](https://cryptpad.fr). Ideally, you already group the applications by gender, e.g. by creating "sheets" for the different genders in the online document and an additional sheet "team" where you can note down the ids of the most promising candidates.

### Team selection call

Once you have found 2-4 people, arrange with them for a video call.

Everyone should have a look at the applications before the call so that decisions can be made quicker.

Team selection criteria:

* technical and statistical skills
* interest in topic / motivation for the project
* can the person learn something on the project?

One spot in the team is reserved for a "beginner".

**Principles of team selection:**

* no discrimation based on gender, gender identity and expression, sexual orientation, disability, mental illness, neuro\(a\)typicality, physical appearance, body size, age, race, ethnicity, nationality or religion.
* at least 50% of team seats are filled with applicants who are not cisgender men \(cisgender = people whose gender identity matches their sex assigned at birth\)
* applicants belonging to groups currently underrepresented in tech should be preferred whenever possible
* people who have unsuccessfully applied to a project in the past should be preferably considered whenever possible 
* people who apply for the first time should be preferably considered compared to people who have already particpated in a project 
* unless in specific circumstances, interviews with applicants are not conducted 
* the selection committee tries to come to a consensus decision. If a consensus cannot be reached, the majority decides. If there is no majority, the project coordinator decides. 

### Confirming team members

Before you send out rejection emails to all those applicants who were not selected for the team you should make sure that everyone is still interested in participating in the project. After all, 1-3 weeks might have passed since they applied and they could've changed their minds. You can use the acceptance email template to get the confirmation.

After everyone has confirmed their interest, you can send out the emails to the applicants who could not be considered. You can use the rejection email template to do this. If you want to send out multiple rejections at once, please make sure to use blind copy \(BCC\).

#### Acceptance Email

{% tabs %}
{% tab title="🇬🇧" %}

{% tab title="🇬🇧 " %}
Subject: \[CorrelAid\] Your application for the project "\[Project name\]"

Dear \[name applicant\],

Thank you for your interest in participating in our project with \[Organisation\]. We were very happy about the applications we received. Unfortunately, the amount of applications \(there were \[number of applications\]\) meant that we had to make a selection.

Unfortunately you are not part of this project. You should not take this as a negative evaluation of your person or your skills. A variety of criteria played a role in our selection - we did not solely select the best-skilled applicants but aimed to put together a team with diverse experiences, skillsets and interests.

Of course, more projects are already in our pipeline and when making our selection, we also take into account whether analysts had unsuccessfully applied to a project in the past. So be sure to mention in your next application that you were not selected for this project. The next opportunity to work on a project will certainly come soon.

In the meantime, please feel free to contact me with questions and ideas at any time.

Best regards

\[Project coordinator\]
