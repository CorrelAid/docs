In this section, you'll find information for project team members about what participating in a CorrelAid Datat4Good Project means and what your concrete tasks are throughout the project. In addition, this includes some thoughts about your self-image and role as Data4Good data scientists, best practices for projects with regards to code quality, collaboration, deployment etc.

Always coordinate with the other project team members and remember: your project team lead and project coordinator are there to help and support you!
