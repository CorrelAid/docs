rename/reframing some of the CorrelAid values (diversity -> respect, knowledge management -> openness/transparency)
add: Courage , Focus, Commitment


## CorrelAid projects are...
... impactful: What we do helps the NPO with its mission and amplifies its impact
... useful and sustainable: The NPO is able to use the results of the project. The project has impact beyond its time frame.
... feasible: The project is realistic to do with a skilled volunteering approach while also ensuring that everyone has a good learning experience.
If you ever have the impression that any of them do not hold anymore during the project, please talk to your project coordinator.

# Roles
[insert what scrum is and why it is useful in IT]

It is not realistic to implement Scrum in a volunteering setting. Hence, we instead focus on proposing roles and accountability that fit for our context. 

## Recommendations:
### Small teams (up to 3)
make sure that the following things are equally distributed:
- maintain a prioritized backlog (i.e. what you would like to get done) and facilitate/organize regular discussions/updates with the NPO about it
- organize/facilitate a regular retrospective 

### Regular teams 
- 1 person: NPO spokesperson/"product owner"
    - maintain contact with NPO
    - update NPO contact person about progress (if they can't join the sprint review regularly)
    - maintain product backlog in discussion with NPO and team
- 1 person: Scrum Master
    - organize internal meetings
    - keep team organized 
    - bi-weekly (ca. 2h): sprint review (with NPO if possible), sprint planning, retrospective
