> When a Product Backlog item or an Increment is described as “Done”, one must understand what ‘Done’ means. Although this may vary significantly for every Scrum Team, members must have a shared understanding of what it means for work to be completed and to ensure transparency. This is the definition of ‘Done’ for the Scrum Team and it is used to assess when work is complete on the product Increment
> In short, DoD is a shared understanding within the Scrum Team on what it takes to make your Product Increment releasable.

A definition of done makes more sense in a software development context where things like testing are much more relevant. However, even for data projects that rely on code, a definition of done can be useful to agree on certain best practices that also apply to data science. Here are some suggestions that could be part of your team's definition of done:

- the code runs / has no defects
- the code is documented / documentation such as README/wiki is updated
- someone else has had a look at the code (peer review)
- the code is in the main branch 

in addition, for more software-oriented projects:
- unit tests pass
- unit test coverage >xx% 
- no errors on coding standards (e.g. lintr)
