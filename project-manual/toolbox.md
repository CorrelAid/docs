# Toolbox

{% hint style="info" %}
I (Frie) know that there are pain points especially with regards to project acquisition (what NPOs are out there? What do I tell them to get them excited on ?). I am working on both finding a technical solution (GDPR compliant, ...) and developing standardized material that you can use to reach out.
{% endhint %}

## PR Material

* [Project examples](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1QggH9B9j0Zc76b1CoKHx4VeVn6tyGD1boDKYdh5LI\_I/edit?usp=sharing) slide deck
* list of projects with linked resources such as podcast episodes, YouTube videos, repositories etc.

## Tools

### General project coordination

* [Kanban Board with all Projects](https://github.com/CorrelAid/projects/projects/1) on GitHub (private, request access from Frie) --> if you could use this, it would be very helpful so that we have an overview! :)
* [Public "database" ](https://github.com/CorrelAid/projectsdb)of (soon-to-be) finished projects on GitHub and accompanying [{projectutils}](https://github.com/CorrelAid/projectutils) R package --> those are displayed on our [website](https://correlaid.org/projects)
