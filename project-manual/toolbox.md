# Toolbox

{% hint style="info" %}
I \(Frie\) know that there are pain points especially with regards to project acquisition \(what NPOs are out there? What do I tell them to get them excited on ?\).  I am working on both finding a technical solution \(GDPR compliant, ...\) and developing standardized material that you can use to reach out. 
{% endhint %}

## Tools

### General project coordination

* [Kanban Board with all Projects](https://github.com/CorrelAid/projects/projects/1) on GitHub \(private, request access from Frie\) --&gt; if you could use this, it would be very helpful so that we have an overview! :\) 
* [Public "database" ](https://github.com/CorrelAid/projectsdb)of \(soon-to-be\) finished projects on GitHub and accompanying [{projectutils}](https://github.com/CorrelAid/projectutils) R package --&gt; those are displayed on our [website](https://correlaid.org/projects)

{% page-ref page="project-coordinators/github-projects-repository.md" %}

### Project acquisition

* Surveymonkey contact form for NPOs --&gt; You can send this to NPOs if you feel like they'd benefit from a structured way to think about their problem
