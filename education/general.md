# General

Our organisation's purpose: **education**! 📚\
We firmly believe that knowledge should be shared so that everyone can benefit from the advantages of data-driven decision-making - regardless of age, level of education or professional background. That's why we offer numerous programmes for non-profits and volunteers.

In addition to our numerous volunteer tutors and workshop holders who are committed to educational purposes at CorrelAid, the Education team consists of a permanent full-time team. You can find an overview on our homepage under the Team tab.

<summary>📎 <strong>How we organise ourselves</strong></summary>

We plan all workshops and courses via Slack. We exchange ideas there and also like to meet up in a huddle or via Zoom to talk in person. Our #education channel is the central place for all educational matters. In the #volunteering-oppurtunities channel, we often publish volunteer positions such as tutor activities. There are also separate planning channels for our courses.
