Data can tell stories... if you know how! In this course, non-profits learn how to create vivid visualizations and compelling data stories. This involves selecting appropriate chart types, designing graphics according to perception principles, and preparing information for different target groups.

Basic experience in working with data or initial exposure to impact management is helpful, but participants do not need any special prior knowledge of visualization; we will start together step by step using practical examples from civil society. Participants will benefit from exchanges with other course participants.
