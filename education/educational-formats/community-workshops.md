**Would you like to pass on and share your knowledge with other CorrelAiders and interested parties? 📢**\
Then a community workshop is just right for you. Our workshops in the “Community Workshops” series are workshops from volunteers for volunteers. Within 60 - 90 minutes, participants gain an insight into a technical or non-technical topic. The workshops are targeted towards a broad audience and are open to anyone who is interested in the topic. Whether it's about data analysis, dashboarding, geodata processing, data visualisation, data ethics, data protection, working in the tech industry, open data and so on...\
You can decide for yourself what you want to cover in your workshop format.

***

**The format 📝**\
In a one to two-hour workshop via Zoom, you give the participants your input on your chosen topic. We take care of everything organisational, such as registration management and follow-up, provide you with a Zoom room and support you during the workshop. This allows you to concentrate fully on your content. So that you can really go for it in your presentation, we will be happy to provide you with a Canva account and send you a CorrelAid slide set if required. The Education team is always available for support, corrections and feedback on your workshop. Simply send us a short message via Slack.

***

**And now? 🚀**\
Do you already have a workshop idea and have the capacity to realise it? Then write us an e-mail to [education@correlaid.org](mailto:education@correlaid.org) or contact us on Slack with your desired topic and we will arrange an initial meeting.
