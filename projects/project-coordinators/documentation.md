# Documentation

until now, the only thing you need to do during the project is to keep your GitHub issue in the [projects repository](/broken/pages/-M-oSWcFKWo2AjTyHIAI) up to date.

If the team has successfully completed the necessary [follow up](follow-up.md) steps, please consider adding the project to the [project database](https://github.com/CorrelAid/projectsdb).
