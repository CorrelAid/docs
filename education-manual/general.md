# General

Our organisation's purpose: **education**! üìö\
We firmly believe that knowledge should be shared so that everyone can benefit from the advantages of data-driven decision-making - regardless of age, level of education or professional background. That's why we offer numerous programmes for non-profits and volunteers.\
\
**An overview of our work**

* We share our **knowledge**, **code** and **materials** publicly where possible while adhering to privacy guidelines.
  * Have a loot at our [educational resources](https://correlaid.org/bildung/ressourcen/)
  * or visit our [GitHub](https://github.com/CorrelAid).
* We offer a variety of **workshops** and **courses** on different data-related topics that directly support NPOs or volunteers in gaining and improving skills in data literacy and data analysis.&#x20;
* We bring **#data4good** to civil society with our two educational courses [R Lernen](educational-formats/r-lernen.md) (2015-2025) and [Daten verstehen und nutzen](educational-formats/daten-verstehen-und-nutzen.md) (2024-2025) for engaged people in NPOs.
* The [CorrelCompact ](educational-formats/correlcompact.md)workshop series is a course-accompanying offer to deepen basic knowledge for NPOs.
* In our [community workshops](educational-formats/community-workshops.md), volunteers from our network share their knowledge with other volunteers.
* Registration for our events usually takes place via our event [calendar](https://correlaid.org/veranstaltungen/?viewType=list).\

üë• **Who we are**\
In addition to our numerous volunteer tutors and workshop holders who are committed to educational purposes at CorrelAid, the Education team consists of a permanent full-time team. You can find an overview on our homepage under the Team tab.

üìé **How we organise ourselves**\
We plan all workshops and courses via Slack. We exchange ideas there and also like to meet up in a huddle or via Zoom to talk in person. Our #education channel is the central place for all educational matters. In the #volunteering-oppurtunities channel, we often publish volunteer positions such as tutor activities. There are also separate planning channels for our courses.\
