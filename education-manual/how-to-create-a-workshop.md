### Tools

The tools used in the event creation are:&#x20;

* [Nextcloud Event deck](https://cloud.correlaid.org/apps/deck/board/67) for task tracking
* [GoogleDoc](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1uByPH0OqM_gj4E6CFbRjCJxWqVXCs-5jeEh6FZRWGa4/edit?usp=sharing) for saving the event description
* Canva for creating beautiful social media posts
* Zoom for creating the video call and invitation link (login info is saved in Bitwarden)
* [Pretix](https://pretix.eu/control) for participant management (they can register for the event and unregister from it and will receive an e-mail with the Zoom Link and a calendar invite, login info is saved in Bitwarden)
* [Kobo](https://kobo.correlaid.org/) for creating feedback forms

In the following sections you can find all the ToDos during each of the phases. These ToDos are also available in the event template card in the [Events Nextcloud Deck](https://cloud.correlaid.org/apps/deck/board/67).

An overview of all events and their descriptions can be found in this [Google Doc](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1uByPH0OqM_gj4E6CFbRjCJxWqVXCs-5jeEh6FZRWGa4/edit?usp=sharing)
