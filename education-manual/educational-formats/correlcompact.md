# CorrelCompact

Our workshops in the ‚ÄúCorrelCompact‚Äù series are aimed at a broad audience from civil society and are open to anyone who is interested in the topic. The focus is particularly on the exchange between committed people, regardless of whether they work full-time or on a voluntary basis. The CorrelCompact workshop series is a course-accompanying offer to deepen basic knowledge for NPOs.
