# Daten verstehen und nutzen

Membership lists, information on fundraising campaigns, participant lists and so on - Do you have data in your organisation and have no idea what to do with it? You need to write something about the impact of your project in your report and have never done anything to measure impact before? You want to tender a data project for your organisation but don't know what all the terms in the ‘world of data’ actually mean? Perhaps you've heard of data literacy but don't know exactly what it means? In our basic 12-week course on ‘Daten verstehen und nutzen" participants tackle these questions together with data professionals in weekly live-sessions.
