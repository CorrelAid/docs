# R Lernen

With the twelve-week course ‘R Lernen - Der Datenkurs von und für die Zivilgesellschaft’, we at CorrelAid e.V. want to help people and organisations who want to make the world a better place with their work to do this more effectively and efficiently. Together with volunteer data professionals, participants will learn how to use data, process it with the statistical programming language R and thus ensure the quality of your programmes, steer them and legitimise them externally. The weekly live-sessions will be practice-orientated and in a small group.
