# Get started

How can you get started at CorrelAid?&#x20;

Basically, there are three ways to get involved at CorrelAid. We talk through them in this short document.

{% hint style="info" %}
We have a monthly [open onboarding call](wiki/communication/conference-calls.md#open-onboarding-call-1st-monday) on the first Monday evening of each month where the following information is talked through in more detail. You can find the calendar event in our [public calendar](https://outlook.office365.com/calendar/published/57caf27cdaf24aa3990ca496bd154ded@correlaid.onmicrosoft.com/e9bfdffe05e9417e9ecbb7b9d3168b4215317299690507860520/calendar.html).&#x20;

## Doing data4good projects

Our data4good projects are probably the main reason why you are thinking about joining CorrelAid. You want to use your skills for the social good? Excellent, you've come to the right place, we've done over 40 projects so far and are constantly talking to new organizations to organize more projects.

It is important to understand that at CorrelAid, there's **no fixed pool of data analysts** who have prioritized access to the projects: There's no secret club of CorrelAid data scientists who exclusively get to work on our data4good projects. Instead, **applications are collected on a per-project basis**. Project call for applications are sent out to our **newsletter email list **and you can **then apply for a specific project **that you consider interesting.&#x20;

{% hint style="warning" %}
There's no need to apply to our info mail with a CV or anything. Just sign up for our [newsletter](https://correlaid.us12.list-manage.com/subscribe?u=b294bf2834adf5d89bdd2dd5a\&id=915f3f3eff) and you'll get all opportunities straight to your inbox.&#x20;
{% endhint %}

So the only thing you need to do to join a CorrelAid data4good project is [sign up for the newsletter](https://correlaid.us12.list-manage.com/subscribe?u=b294bf2834adf5d89bdd2dd5a\&id=915f3f3eff) and wait until a cool project comes around! Depending on the month, we start 1-4 projects per month.&#x20;

Sign up for our newsletter [here](https://correlaid.us12.list-manage.com/subscribe?u=b294bf2834adf5d89bdd2dd5a\&id=915f3f3eff).

## Connect with other data analysts

### CorrelAidX

If you want to network with other data scientists, consider joining one of our CorrelAidX chapters. While CorrelAid is a remote organisation, we also have local chapters that meet in-person regularly. You can find all local chapters along with contact addresses on our [website](https://correlaid.org/en/correlaid-x/). If you want to start your own chapter, feel free to reach out to Phil.

### Slack

Regardless of whether a local chapter is close to you or not, you can always request to join our [Slack](wiki/communication/slack.md#i-want-to-get-access-to-slack-how-do-i-get-it) to find community there.&#x20;

## Get involved in the core team

The core team is the organizational team of CorrelAid which keeps us running. From organizing projects and creating educational content to writing grant applications - there is loads to do. The core team is divided into different subteams:

* **project coordination team**: the project coordination team coordinates the data4good projects, i.e. they talk to the organization, find out how we can help them and sends out the project call for applications. They usually _do not actively code _for the projects. Relevant Slack channels: #projects, and a private channel you will be added to if you're interested in becoming a project coordinator.
* **education team**: this team creates educational content and organizes projects that benefit our network members. They also aim to create content for NPOs about data organization and simple data analysis skills. Finally, our Podcast [CorrelTalk](https://www.spreaker.com/show/correltalk-the-correlaid-podcast) is  produced by members of the education team. Relevant Slack channels: #education, #podcast.&#x20;
* **PR team**: from filling our blog to posting on social media to designing stickers and other [CorrelAid merch](wiki/correlaid-merch.md). The PR team is responsible for everything that represents CorrelAid to the outside. Relevant channels: #pr, #pr-team.&#x20;
* **fundraising team**: the fundraising team looks out for funding opportunities for CorrelAid, collaborates with other organizations on grant proposals etc. Relevant Slack channels: #fundraising.
* **infrastructure team**: the infrastructure team takes care of our hugo website, our cloud resources, the CorrelAid Slackbot, the self-hosted [CodiMD](wiki/infrastructure/codimd.md) and the administration of our NextCloud instance [CorrelCloud](wiki/infrastructure/correlcloud.md). They also actively develop said tools - especially CodiMD and the website - so if you're a (JS / Python / Frontend) developer, this is the right place to get involved! :woman\_technologist: :man\_technologist:&#x20;

If you want to be involved in the core team, it's best to do the following:

1. Write an email to [Frie](mailto:frie.p@correlaid.org) explaining where you'd like to participate. You'll then get an invite to our [Slack](wiki/communication/slack.md).&#x20;
2. You'll probably also need an [CodiMD](wiki/infrastructure/codimd.md) account later on.&#x20;
