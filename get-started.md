# Get started

How can you get started at CorrelAid? This depends a bit on what you want to do as part of our network. 

## Doing data4good projects

Our data4good projects are probably the main reason why you are thinking about joining CorrelAid. You want to use your skills for the social good? Excellent, you've come to the right place, we've done over 40 projects so far and are constantly talking to new organizations to organize more projects.

At CorrelAid, there's **no fixed pool of data analysts** that have prioritized access to the projects. There's no secret club of CorrelAid data scientists who exclusively get to work on data4good projects. Instead, **applications are collected on a per-project basis**. Project call for applications are sent out to our newsletter email list and you can then apply for a specific project that you consider interesting. 

So the only thing you need to do to join a CorrelAid data4good project is [sign up for the newsletter](https://correlaid.us12.list-manage.com/subscribe?u=b294bf2834adf5d89bdd2dd5a&id=915f3f3eff) and wait until a cool project comes around! Depending on the month, we start 1-4 projects per month.
